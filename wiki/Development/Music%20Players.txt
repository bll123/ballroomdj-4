###### VLC

* Support for speed changes, including during playback.
* Good API.
* Not likely to go away.
* VLC will use the volume sink set by the application.

###### MPRIS

* Linux only
* This interface has been started, but is unfinished.
* This interface required that the dynamic library description
be changed to return multiple items (done).
* The chosen player interface will not always be available.  Starting
the player after starting BDJ4 may be problematic.
* Also should fallback to VLC if the chosen player is not available.

###### GStreamer

* Not sure how to get working on MacOS and Windows
* GStreamer has a rate change, but does not adjust the pitch.

###### MPV

* Support for speed changes.
* The library interfaces requires that LC_NUMERIC be set to "C".
<br>Incompetent programmers.  This required saving the current
LC_NUMERIC setting and restoring it afterwards within the MPV interface.
* The MPV library is linked with graphics libraries.
<br>More incompetent programmers.
* MPV will NOT use the volume sink set by the application.  The volume
sink must be set via the MPV API, and the MPV internal name must be used.
* Status: an interface has been written, but it is not working
right.  MPV is low priority.
* 2024-2-1: The MPV interface is much improved, but MPV is buggy.  The
'time-pos' property stops getting reported correctly after certain
operations.  Due to this bug, development on MPV is stopped.
