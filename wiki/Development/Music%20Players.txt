###### VLC

* Support for speed changes, including during playback.
* Good API.
* Not likely to go away.

###### MPV

* Support for speed changes.
* The library interfaces requires that LC_NUMERIC be set to "C".
<br>Incompetent programmers.  This required saving the current
LC_NUMERIC and restoring it afterwards within the MPV interface.
* The MPV library is linked with graphics libraries.
<br>More incompetent programmers.
* Status: an interface has been written, but it is not working
right.  MPV is low priority.
