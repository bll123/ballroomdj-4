##### GTK-3

GTK-3 is ok.  There are some issues.

* There is some documentation that is incorrect.
* It's hard to find good examples.
* The developers are in the mode where they know best.
The customers are being ignored.
* Some of the design choices are very poor and questionable.
* Comboboxes/Dropdowns are horrid.  No scrollbars, no height limit.
I would not subject my users to these.
* The application level interface should be completely separated.
I was not able to use the application level interface as it made macos
completely non-performant.
* Bug: I have three identical treeviews (same code) within the window.
One of them does not get initialized with the same height as the others.
This is no longer an issue, as all use of gtk treeviews have been
removed.
* Bug: gtk_init() and gtk_get_locale_direction() only work if and only if
the locale has not been set.  Setting a new locale and calling
gtk_get_locale_direction() again does not work.

##### GTK-4

No work has been done on porting to GTK-4.
