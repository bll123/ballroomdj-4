GTK is ok.  There are some issues.

* There is some documentation that is incorrect.
* It's hard to find good examples.
* The developers are in the mode where they know best.
The customers are being ignored.
* Some of the design choices are very poor and questionable.
* Comboboxes/Dropdowns are horrid.  No scrollbars, no height limit.
I would not subject my users to these.
* The application level interface should be completely separated.
I was not able to use the application level interface as it made macos
complete non-performant.
* gtk_init mucks up the locale, it has to be reset after calling
gtk_init.
* Bug: I have three identical treeviews (same code) within the window.
One of them does not get initialized with the same height as the others.
