Mutagen is a python script, and this is why a python installation is
necessary.

Due to its high portability and excellent support, mutagen was chosen
as the mp3 tagging tool. It is much better than some of the tagging
libraries that are available.

BDJ4 uses the standard output from mutagen, so unicode always
needs to be tested carefully when there is a new release.

As mutagen is not compiled, mp3 tag handling is slower. Most of the
time this does not matter much.

Mutagen's support level seems to have dropped.  And the
mutagen-inspect program / pprint() doesn't seem to be supported at all.
The MP4 output is dumping out python code.

Mutagen will be removed from BDJ4 as of version 4.2.2.2.
It will no longer be necessary to install python.
