## Mutagen

Mutagen is a python script, and this is why a python installation is
necessary.

Due to its high portability and excellent support, mutagen was chosen
as the mp3 tagging tool. It is much better than some of the tagging
libraries that are available.

BDJ4 uses the standard output from mutagen, so unicode always
needs to be tested carefully when there is a new release.

As mutagen is not compiled, mp3 tag handling is slower. Most of the
time this does not matter much.

Mutagen's support level seems to have dropped.  Another possibility to
look at is taglib.  This will require writing a C wrapper around the
C++ code.
