For a metadata library, I want support for MP3, Ogg, Opus, FLAC, and
M4A.

Unfortunately, the tagging libraries that are available often skip
over unknown tags.

An audio tagging library should never lose any metadata when
reading in tags and then subsequently writing out the tags.

At this time, I am working on writing my own interfaces to various
metadata libraries.  MP3, Ogg, Opus and FLAC are all fairly easy,
though I will have to be sure to meet the requirement of not losing
any metadata.

I am still looking for an M4A metadata library.

2023-11-2 I wrote my own MP4 tagging library so that Mutagen could be
removed.  I also wrote code to support read-only tags in RIFF (.wav)
and ASF (.wma) files.  What's not supported are ID3 tags in non-MP3
audio files.

Another possibility to look at is taglib.  This will require writing a
C wrapper around the C++ code.  It appears that taglib does not return
the data for unsupported tags.  Rather useless.

tagparser also did not support all tags.

ffmpeg's libav* libraries appear to support the metadata quite well, but
MP3 _UFID_ tag and M4A _tmpo_ tag are not supported.  Custom M4A audio
tags are skipped completely.
