====== VLC Installation for development:

Start the VLC installer, drag the VLC installation to
$HOME/Applications.  Rename to VLC3.app and VLC4.app.

====== Setting up MacOS

VNC:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/339114/allowing-vnc-to-control-computer-under-10-14-mojave

<br>Open : system preferences / security & privacy / privacy / accessibility
<br>Using the finder :
<br>Drag this file : /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/
<br>      AppleVNCServer.bundle/Contents/MacOS/AppleVNCServer
<br>The bundle has to be opened with a right-click, show package contents.
<br>Drag this file also: sshd-keygen-wrapper

<br>Older Mac OS X: login screen picture:
<br>/Library/Caches/com.apple.desktop.admin.png
<br>Mojave: replace:
<br>/Library/Desktop Pictures/Mojave.heic (really a .png)

<br>Sharing:
<br> Turn on screen sharing and remote login.
<br> Change computer name.
<br> screen sharing: set VNC password
<br> For both screen sharing and remote login, make sure the allowed users
<br>and groups are correct.
<br> For each user:
<br> Right click on user, advanced options, change directory to point
to /Volumes/Users (Mojave and prior currently have symlinks).
Need an extra admin account to change other accounts.
<br> Users:
<br> login options : change to name and password.

Add terminal with full disk access:
<br>Security & Privacy / Privacy / Full Disk Access : turn on terminal.

Add user to _developer group:
<br>sudo dscl . append /Groups/_developer GroupMembership <username>

/etc/paths:
<br>/opt/local/bin

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
<br>default_transport = smtp:localhost:8025

scutil --set HostName bll-mac.ballroomdj.org

# to reset the keychain password
<br>security set-keychain-password

# run this first to get all the bdj4 requirements installed
<br>$HOME/bdj4/install/macos-pre-install-macports.sh

sudo port install autossh di rlwrap                   # for bll
<br>sudo port install check cmake pkgconfig sshpass   # for bdj4.
<br>sudo port uninstall gtk3
<br>sudo port install gtk3-devel

  To boot into safe mode:
<br>    Hold down the Shift key.
<br>  To select a partition to boot:
<br>    Hold down the Alt key.
<br>  To restart to access disk utility, etc:
<br>    Hold down Meta-R.
<br>  To clear PRAM/NVRAM:
<br>    Hold down Meta-Alt-P-R.
<br>  To restart to restore from the internet:
<br>    Alt-D

====== MacOS GUI (Cocoa AppKit)

In progress.

Margins are a problem.  AppKit has constraints, but these work as
relative adjustments against neighbors, and having info on neighbors
ahead of time is not particularly reasonable.  Also, everything has
to be packed before a constraint will work.

layoutMarginsGuide looked perfect, but does not seem to work, or I am
using it wrong.   I am going to try adding my own layout guide to the
nsview (widget) and see what happens.

Since the constraints require the widgets to be packed, all of the
size-group, margin, etc. changes must be moved after the pack
statement.  This is not a big issue.  Some are done already.

Having the notebook put the tabs on the left doesn't work well.  MacOS
configures the tabs with vertical text, rather than horizontal text.
The nstabviewitem is not very configurable. I will probably need to do
my own tabs, which is possible, they have controls to do that.  And
getting the selection image into the tab is problematic also, so doing
my own tabs will work out fine.

I also have the weird placement of 'set queue for playback' button.
With gtk this button is forced into the notebook view.  If I do my own
tabs, I can place this without any issue.   There are a couple of
options here.  a) I can re-work the gui so that the button placement is
different, though that gets back to the original problem of where to
put it. b) Since I'm going to have to write my own tab handling for
macos, placement will be easy.  But this doesn't solve the issue for
other guis in the future.

There doesn't seem to be any easy way to change the font for all
widgets.  I think the system-font size can be set, so that's one
option.  May need to set the font individually for every widget.

Solved issues:

Size groups: Set the trailing-anchor constraint to match all other
widgets in the size group.  Widgets must be packed before setting the
size group.

Pack End: This works by using add-view at-index within the trailing
gravity group to match what gtk does.
