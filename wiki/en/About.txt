## About BallroomDJ 4

BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 (BDJ4) is a music player designed for laptops and
desktops.  It is designed to play music for an entire evening without
any intervention.

BDJ4 provides the tools to organize the ballroom music by dance and
into song lists, sequences and automatic playlists. Though it is
designed for the needs of ballroom music, it can be used for any type
of music.

The original BallroomDJ was started in 2011.  Around 2021 I determined
that the programming language used, Tcl/Tk, was no longer a viable
option in which to continue.  And to ensure the long term existence of
a ballroom music player, the programming language and tools used
needed to change.

BDJ4 is a complete rewrite designed to replace BallroomDJ 3.  Work
started on BDJ4 in December of 2021.  BDJ4 is not an upgrade to
BallroomDJ, but rather a separate installation with its own database
and configuration files.  A conversion process can be used during
installation to convert the BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 data files and database
to files that can be used by BDJ4.
