## About BallroomDJ 4

BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 (BDJ4) is a music player designed for laptops and
desktops.  It is designed to play music for an entire evening without
any intervention.

BDJ4 provides the tools to organize the ballroom music by dance and
into song lists, sequences and automatic playlists. Though it is
designed for the needs of ballroom music, it can be used for any type
of music.

The original BallroomDJ was started in 2011.  At that time, there were
two commercial options available.  One was quite expensive, and the
other (which was being used locally in several ballrooms, and which I
had a small familiarity with) had a terrible user interface.

I decided that if I was ever going to do ballroom DJ work, that I
wanted something better, and I set out to write a new program, and
BallroomDJ was started and grew for the next 10 years.

Around 2021 I determined that the programming language used for
BallroomDJ, Tcl/Tk, was no longer a viable option in which to
continue.  And to ensure the long term existence of a ballroom music
player, the programming language and tools used needed to change.

BDJ4 is a complete rewrite designed to replace BallroomDJ 3.  Work
started on BDJ4 in December of 2021.  BDJ4 is not an upgrade to
BallroomDJ, but rather a separate installation with its own database
and configuration files.  A conversion process can be used during
installation to convert the BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 data files and database
to files that can be used by BDJ4.
