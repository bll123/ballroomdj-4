### Contributing to BallroomDJ 4 Development

As of 2025-8-9, development needs are:

* Translations
* All Platforms: Unit Testing, Testing and QA
* Audio Sources:
    * Spotify
      I will not be working on this, other than providing guidance to
      whoever takes this on.
* Windows: SMTC: Use image from audio file.
  For whatever reason, a call to initialize the apartment crashes.
* Player Interface
    * Windows Native
      I have attempted to write this, but it crashes.
      c++/winrt/windows-api seems to be fragile and hard to work with.

    * Spotify
      I will not be working on this, other than providing guidance to
      whoever takes this on.
* User Interface:
    * Windows Native UI
    * MacOS Native UI
      Some attempt has been made for this. Progress is stopped at this time.
      This could be written using SwiftUI.
    * Ultimate&#43;&#43;
    * Qt Widgets
    * Flutter
    * Nuklear (no macos?, could still be useful)
    * N-Curses ?  But internationalization will not work on windows.
