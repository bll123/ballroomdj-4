### Contributing to BallroomDJ 4 Development

Practice the three C's: Consideration, Cooperations, Conscientousness.

As of 2025-8-9, development needs are:

* Translations
* All Platforms: Unit Testing, Testing and QA
* Audio Sources:
    * Spotify
      I will not be working on this, other than providing guidance to
      whoever takes this on.
    * Apple Music
      I will not be working on this, other than providing guidance to
      whoever takes this on.
* Volume Interface
    * Windows - Needs to be modernized and updated
* Player Interface
    * Spotify
      I will not be working on this, other than providing guidance to
      whoever takes this on.
    * Apple Music
      I will not be working on this, other than providing guidance to
      whoever takes this on.
* User Interface:
    * ncurses (is a lightweight non-gui version useful?)
    * Qt Widgets
    * Kotlin Multiplatform
    * Flutter
    * Windows Native UI (winrt preferred)
    * MacOS Native UI
      Some more progress has been made on this as of 2026-1.
    * Tablets/iPad: Android / iOS
      This would be a major task.
      A completely new UI/UX would need to be designed for the small screen.
    * Ultimate&#43;&#43;
    * Nuklear (no macos?, could still be useful)
