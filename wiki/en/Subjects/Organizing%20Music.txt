### Organizing Music

The audio files on your computer may be renamed to match the
organization that you want.

###### Configuration the Organization Path

In [Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Organization](en-Configuration-Organization),
the organization path may be set to match your setup.

Note that there is only a small set of organization paths that ship
with BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 by default, but many more can be configured.

If the organization path you want is not listed in the drop-down
selection, the data/orgopt.txt file can be modified to include the
organization path that you want.  This must be done manually using a
text editor. [Contact the BDJ4 development team](Getting%20Help) for
help.

###### Manually Renaming the Audio Files

Once the organization path has been set to your satisfaction, open the
management screen and select __Update Database__.  Select
_Reorganize_ in the __Action__ selection.  Select the __Start__
button.

After the reorganization is complete, exit BDJ4 and restart BDJ4 to
ensure the database is reloaded.

###### Automatic Organization

In [Configuration&nbsp;/&nbsp;Organization](en-Configuration-Organization),
If the _Auto Organize_ switch is on, your audio files will
automatically be renamed when using
_Update&nbsp;Database&nbsp;/&nbsp;Check&nbsp;for&nbsp;New_ and when
changing the song data in the
[Song&nbsp;Editor](en-Management-Song%20Editor).
