### Profiles

A profile is used when a different BDJ4 configuration is desired.
Different profiles have their own configuration and use the same
music database.

A profile can be set up for teaching, for use with headphones, for
ballroom dance parties, for different locations, or other uses.

To set up an alternate folder with a separate database, use an
[Altnernate Folder](en-Subjects-Alternate%20Folders).

##### Creating a New Profile

Start BDJ4, then select __Create&nbsp;Profile__ in the __Profile__
selection.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![profile-create](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/profile-create-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Starter / Create Profile__</span> </div>

Select __Configure__.

In the __General__ tab in the configuration, there are two fields
related to profiles.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![profile-setup](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/profile-setup-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Configure / General (profile)__</span> </div>

__Profile Name__: The profile name will appear in the profile
selection of the starter window and will display in the title bar of
each window.

__Profile Color__: When a profile is first created, a new profile
color will be selected.  A small box using the profile color is
displayed in the top right corner of each window for quick
identification of which profile is in use.  Select the color button
to choose a new color for the new profile.

In the [Marquee Configuration](en-Configuration-Marquee), the
__Show&nbsp;Marquee__ setting may be set to _Off_.

Close the configuration window and re-start BDJ4.

After restart, the starter window will show the new profile names
in the profile selection along with the selected profile colors.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![profile-new](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/profile-new-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Starter__</span> </div>

The profile order cannot be changed.  BDJ4 chooses the first empty
profile slot to create a new profile.  A maximum of 10 profiles may be
created.

##### Selecting Profiles

When BDJ4 is started, the first profile will automatically be selected.

Select the profile to use.  Once a button in the starter window has
been selected, the profile is set and may not be changed.

If a second instance of BDJ4 is started, the profiles that are in use
may not be selected.  A different profile may be selected and the
second instance of BDJ4 will use that profile.

##### Deleting Profiles

Start BDJ4, select the profile to be deleted, then in the starter
window, select __Delete&nbsp;Profile__ from the __Actions__ menu.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![profile-delete](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/profile-delete-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Starter__</span> </div>

##### Using Multiple Profiles

Multiple profiles may be in use at the same time.

In the [Player Configuration](en-Configuration-Player), the audio
output sink can be configured per-profile.  As an example, the DJ
could start BDJ4 with one profile for a ballroom party and start a
second instance of BDJ4 using a different profile to listen to music
on their USB headphones.
