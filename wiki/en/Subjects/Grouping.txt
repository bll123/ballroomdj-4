### Grouping

Songs may be linked together in groups so that all of the linked songs
are played when one is selected.  This is mostly used in classical
music to link all of the movements for a work together.

The audio tags applicable to grouping songs are _Grouping_, _Work_,
_Movement&nbsp;Number_, _Track&nbsp;_ and _Title_.

Grouping is fully implemented starting in BDJ4 version 4.12.7.

#### How a Group is Selected

A group of songs is either selected based on the _Grouping_ tag, or if
the song is set as a classical genre and the _Work_ tag is set or the
work can be extracted from the song title.

The priorities are in the following order:
   * _Grouping_ is set.
   * The genre is classical and _Work_ is set.
   * The genre is classical and the work can be extracted from the song title.

If the movement number is set, the group will be ordered by movement
number.  Otherwise the group is ordered by disc number and track number.

If the _Grouping_ tag is used, and you want a particular order for the
songs, set the movement number.

#### Song Selection and Right Click

In song selection (requests, music manager, song selection), the right
mouse button may be used to select an entire group of songs.

#### Automatic and Sequenced Playlists

In automatic and sequenced playlists, if a song that is part of a
group is selected, the entire group of songs will be played in order.
