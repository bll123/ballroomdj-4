### Moving BDJ4 to a New Computer

Some configuration options are stored on a per-computer basis, as
different computers may have different hardware installed or
connected, or different fonts or themes installed.

When copying BDJ4 to a new computer, the configuration options from
the old computer will not be located, as they are stored in a folder
named after the old computer.

##### Determine the Computer Names

On your old computer, check the name of your computer.
<br>Windows: Select __Settings__ / __System__ / __About__ (Device&nbsp;Name).
<br>Linux: Use the __hostname__ command in a terminal.
<br>MacOS: In __Applications__, select __System&nbsp;Settings__ / General / About (Name).
<br>MacOS: Select the __Apple__ menu / __About&nbsp;this&nbsp;Mac__ / __More&nbsp;Info__ (Name).
<br>MacOS: Use the __hostname__ command in a terminal.

Likewise, on your new computer, check the name of your computer.

##### Copy BDJ4 to the New Computer

Copy the entire BDJ4 folder to the new computer.

##### Copy the Configuration Folder

In the _BDJ4/data_ folder, there is a folder named after the old
computer. e.g. If your old computer was named _desktop-n02iqro_, there
will be a _BDJ4/data/desktop-n02iqro_ folder.

On the new computer, copy the folder named after the old computer
(e.g. in this example _BDJ4/data/desktop-n02iqro_) to the _BDJ4/data_
folder using the new computer name.

Many file managers will create a folder called
_Copy&nbsp;of&nbsp;desktop-n02iqro_. In this case, rename the folder
to the name of the new computer after it is copied.
