<span id="blurb" style="color:#4559bf;">_The song selection, request and music
manager song listings can be filtered to display selected songs._</span>

### Filter Dialog

The filter dialog is available in the song selection, request and
music manager song listings by selecting the filter button
(![Filter&nbsp;Songs](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/FilterSongsButton-A.png)).

The following filters are available:

* Playlist (Music Manager only)
* Sort By
* Search
* Genre
* Dance
* Dance Rating
* Dance Level
* Status
* Favorite
* Playable Status

The Genre, Dance Level, Status, Favorite and Playable Status filters
are not displayed in the default configuration.  These can be turned
on in [Configuration&nbsp;/&nbsp;Dialogs](en-Configuration-Dialogs).

After selecting the filters to be applied, select the __Apply__ button
to update the song listing.

Selecting __Reset__ will reset the filters back to their defaults and
update the song listing.

The _Request_ song listing will always set the _Playable&nbsp;Status_
filter on.  If the [status](en-Configuration-Edit%20Status) field is
not in use, this has no effect, as all songs are set to be playable.

__Playlist__: Only available in the music manager.  Selecting a
playlist will filter the song listing based on the type of playlist
and the playlist settings.  Selecting a song list will only show the
songs in the song list.  Selecting an automatic or sequenced playlist
will show all songs that could be played by the selected playlist.
When a playlist is selected, all other filters are disabled.

__Sort By__: Allows selection of what sort order to apply to the song
listing.  Note that for album, album&nbsp;artist, artist, composer and
title, if the song has a matching sort order audio tag set, the sort
order audio tag will be used for sorting purposes.

__Search__: Searches the title, artist, album&nbsp;artist, notes, keyword,
tags, album, composer and conductor for the specified text. The search
is not case sensitive.

__Genre__: Matches the selected genre (not displayed in default
configuration).

__Dance__: Matches the selected dance.

__Dance Rating__: Matches any song with rating at the selected level
or better.

__Dance Level__: Matches the selected dance level (not displayed in
default configuration).

__Status__: Matches the selected status (not displayed in default
configuration).

__Favorite__: Matches the selected favorite setting (not displayed in
default configuration).

__Playable Status__: Matches any song with a
[status](en-Configuration-Edit%20Status) that has the _Play?_ checkbox
turned on (not displayed in default configuration).
