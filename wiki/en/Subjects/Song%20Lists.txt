### Song Lists

A song list is the easiest playlist to understand.  It is simply a
list of songs played in the selected order.

See: [Edit Song Lists](en-Management-Edit%20Song%20Lists) for details
on the buttons and menus.

##### Changing the Name of the Song List

The song list's name is at the top of the _Song&nbsp;List_ tab. Enter
the new name of the song list at any time.

On all platforms, the slash and backslash characters are not allowed
in song list names.

On Windows, the following characters are not allowed in song list names:
**&nbsp;*&nbsp;'&nbsp;"&nbsp;:&nbsp;|&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;^&nbsp;**

If you forget to change the song list's name, it probably has the name
_New&nbsp;Song&nbsp;List_.  In _Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists_, select
__Load__ from the __Edit__ menu.  Select _New&nbsp;Song&nbsp;List_.
Change the name of the song list.  The song list will be renamed.

##### Creating a Song List Manually

Select __Manage__ from the starter window.  The
Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists tab will be displayed.

In the song selection (the right side of the screen in the
side-by-side view), select the songs to be played and select the left
arrow button (![Left
Arrow](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/LeftButton-B.png))
to add them to the song list.  The _Statistics_ tab can be used to
view how many songs, the total play time and how many songs for each
dance have been selected.

Move the songs up and down to change the order in which they will be
played.  The _Swap_ action in the _Actions_ menu can be used to
swap two songs.

The song list will be saved automatically.

##### Using the Mix Action

Re-arranging all of the songs in a song list can be a large amount of
work.  To make the process easier, the _Mix_ action can be used.

Again, select the songs to be added to the song list.  Use the
_Statistics_ tab to check how many songs of each dance are selected.
After selecting all the songs for the song list, select the __Mix__
action in the _Actions_ menu.

The song list will be re-ordered based on various rules built in to
BDJ4.

Review the song list and move the songs up and down to fine tune the
order which they will be played.  The _Swap_ action in the _Actions_
menu can be used to swap two songs.

If you don't like the order of the song list, select the __Mix__
action again to create a new order, then review the song list and fine
tune the order.

The song list will be saved automatically.

##### Re-Using Song Lists

Once you have a song list with a good mix, you can create copies and
modify the copy to create a new song list.

Select __Load__ from the __Edit__ menu and select the song list you
want to use as the starting point.  Select __Create&nbsp;Copy__ from
the __Edit__ menu.  A new song list will be created.  Note that the
name of the song list is now _Copy&nbsp;of&nbsp;..._.

Change the name of the song list.

Select a song in the song list that you want to replace.  From the
song selection, select a new song of the same dance and add it to the
song list.  Re-select the song being replaced and select the remove
button
(![remove](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/RemoveSongButton-B.png)).

Continue to replace songs until you are satisfied with the new song
list.

##### Playlist Controls

Every song list has an associated playlist.  If a song list is loaded
in the song list editor, switching to the
[Playlist&nbsp;Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management) tab
will automatically load the associated playlist.

The ___Settings___ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_ has the controls for
_Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time_, _Stop&nbsp;At_, _Stop&nbsp;After_,
_Gap_ and _Play&nbsp;Announcements_.

In the _Dances_ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_, the
_Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time_ for a particular dance can be set.

##### Creating a Song List from an Automatic or Sequenced Playlist

A song list can also be created from an
[Automatic&nbsp;Playlist](en-Subjects-Automatic&nbsp;Playlists) or
[Sequenced&nbsp;Playlist](en-Subjects-Sequenced&nbsp;Playlists).

Select __Start&nbsp;New&nbsp;Playlist__ in the __Edit__ menu.
Select __Create&nbsp;From&nbsp;Playlist__ in the __Actions__ menu.

Select the playlist to use, and adjust the time limit (hours and
minutes) to set how long the song list should play.

Select __Create__, and the song list will be generated based on the
playlist selected.

Review the song list and move the songs up and down to fine tune the
order which they will be played.  The _Swap_ action in the _Actions_
menu can be used to swap two songs.

If you don't like the order of the song list, the __Mix__
action described above can be used to re-order the song list.

If you don't like the song selections that were made, start a new song
list and use the _Create&nbsp;From&nbsp;Playlist_ action again.

The [playlist&nbsp;settings](en-Management-Playlist%20Management)
(except _Stop&nbsp;After_) and the _Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time_ for a dance
will be propagated from the automatic or sequenced playlist to the
new song list.
