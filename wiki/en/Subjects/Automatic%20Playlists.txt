### Automatic Playlists

When an automatic playlist is used, BDJ4 will choose both the dances
to be played, and choose the songs to be played.

A sample automatic playlist is installed with BDJ4.

##### Changing the Name of the Automatic Playlist

The automatic playlist's name is at the top of the
_Playlist&nbsp;Management_ tab. Enter the new name of the automatic
playlist at any time.

On all platforms, the slash and backslash characters are not allowed
in playlist names.

On Windows, the following characters are not allowed in playlist names:
**&nbsp;*&nbsp;'&nbsp;"&nbsp;:&nbsp;|&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;^&nbsp;**

If you forget to change the name, the automatic playlist will be named
_New&nbsp;Playlist_.  Select __Load__ from the __Edit__ menu.  Select
_New&nbsp;Playlist_.  Change the name of the automatic playlist.

##### Creating an Automatic Playlist

Select __Manage__ in the start window.  Select
__Playlist&nbsp;Management__.  In the __Edit__ menu, select
__New&nbsp;Automatic&nbsp;Playlist__.

Select the __Dances__ tab.  In the first column of the dances tab, the
checkbox indicates whether the dance may be played.  Select the dances
that you want to be played when using this playlist.  Once you have
finished selecting all the dances, the __Hide&nbsp;Unselected__
checkbox in the upper right corner may be activated to hide the unused
dances.

For an automatic playlist, each dance must have a __Count__ assigned.
The count is not an absolute value, but is relative to the other dances.
E.g. if _Waltz_ is set to 8, and _Rumba_ is set to 4, there will be
approximately twice as many Waltzes played than Rumbas.  If the count
is zero, the dance will not be played.

If you know how many of each dance you want played for a dance
session, use those numbers to set the __Count__.  If the dance session
is shorter or longer, the same relative number of each dance will be
played.

To change a count, select the dance row, then click on the count.
Select the __+__ and __-__ buttons to adjust the count.  Click on a
different dance to finalize the change.

##### Dance and Song Selection

BDJ4 chooses the next dance to be played using an algorithm based on
the dance, the type of dance, the speed of the dance and the tags set
for the dance.

<br>[Configuration&nbsp;/&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;Dances](en-Configuration-Edit%20Dances)

BDJ4 chooses the song from the songs filtered by any playlist song
selection filters.

<br>[Playlist&nbsp;Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management)

The song to be played is chosen based on the
[Dance&nbsp;Rating](en-Configuration-Edit%20Ratings) and
[Dance&nbsp;Level](en-Configuration-Edit%20Levels) (optional).

The dance rating and dance level have weights assigned to them that
adjust which song will be played.  A dance rating with a higher weight
will be played more often.  The dance rating is the primary selection
criteria.

In addition, same-song marks are checked to make sure that only one song
from those songs marked as the same song is used.

##### Playlist Controls

The _Settings_ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_ has the controls for
_Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time, _Stop&nbsp;At_, _Stop&nbsp;After_,
_Gap_ and _Play&nbsp;Announcements_.

The song filter associated with the playlist can also be changed in
the _Settings_ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_.  The songs can
filtered by _Dance&nbsp;Rating_, _Dance&nbsp;Level_, and
_Allowed&nbsp;Keywords_.  In addition, in the _Dances_ tab, the songs
can be filtered by _Low&nbsp;MPM_ and _High&nbsp;MPM_ per dance.

In the _Dances_ tab, the _Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time_ for a
particular dance can be set.
