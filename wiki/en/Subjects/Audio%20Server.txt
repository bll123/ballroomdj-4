### BDJ4 Audio Server

A BDJ4 audio server can be used to allow remote playback of songs.

BDJ4 to BDJ4 connections have the advantage that speed adjustments,
song start and song end all work.

#### Configuring a BDJ4 Server

Select __Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Audio&nbsp;Sources__.  BDJ4 ships with a
audio source named _BDJ4_ that is set to _Off_.  For this
example, this audio source will be re-configured.

Change __Mode__ to _Server_.

Change the __Name__ to your preference. For this example, the name
will be set to _BDJ4-Server_.

__Type__ is set to _BDJ4_.

The __Port__ can be left on 9011 or changed to your preference.  Port
numbers below 1024 are reserved and cannot be used by BDJ4.

Configuring a BDJ4 server so that it can be reached from the outside
can be difficult, and is outside the scope of this wiki.  Solutions
can use SSH tunnels to an outside server, or running the bdj4server on
an outside server.

Be sure to set the __User__ and __Password__ to your desired user and
password combinations.

#### Starting the Server

Once the server is configured, it will be automatically started when
BDJ4 is started.  Exit BDJ4 completely, then restart BDJ4, and the
server will be active.

See [Subjects / BDJ4 Audio Client](en-Subjects-Audio%20Client) on how
to set up a client connection to a server.  Note that the client and
server cannot be configured on the same machine.
