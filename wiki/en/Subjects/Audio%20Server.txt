### BDJ4 Audio Server

A BDJ4 audio server can be used to allow remote playback of songs.  At
this time (2025-4-20), only a BDJ4 to BDJ4 connection can be used.

BDJ4 to BDJ4 connections have the advantage that speed adjustments,
song start and song end all work.

##### Configuring BDJ4 as a Server

Select __Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Audio&nbsp;Sources__.  BDJ4 ships with a
single audio source named _BDJ4_ that is set to _Off_.  For this
example, this audio source will be re-configured.

Change __Mode__ to _Server_.

Change the __Name__ to your preference. For this example, the name
will be set to _BDJ4-Server_.

__Type__ is set to _BDJ4_.  At this time (2025-4-20), this is only
type that is supported.

The __Port__ can be left on 9011 or changed to your preference.

Be sure to set the __User__ and __Password__ to your desired user and
password combinations.

##### Starting the Server

Once the server is configured, it will be automatically started when
BDJ4 is started.  Exit BDJ4 completely, then restart BDJ4, and the
server will be active.

See [Subjects / Audio Client](en-Subjects-Audio%20Client) on how to set up a
client connection to a server.  Note that the client and server cannot
be configured on the same machine.
