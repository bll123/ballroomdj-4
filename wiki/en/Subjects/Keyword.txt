<span style="color:#4559bf;">_A keyword is used to indicate a special
category and prevent the song from being selected for automatic and
sequenced playlists._</span>

### Keyword

A single keyword may be set for a song in the [Song&nbsp;Editor].
When a keyword is set, the song will not be selected for automatic and
sequenced playlists unless the playlist has the keyword present in the
__Allowed Keywords__ list.

The common use of the keyword is to indicate holiday songs.  Songs
that are for holiday occasions would have the keyword set.  These
songs will be excluded from automatic and sequenced playlists unless
the playlist configuration allows the keyword.
