<span id="blurb" style="color:#4559bf;">_A keyword is used to indicate a special
category and prevent the song from being selected for automatic and
sequenced playlists._</span>

### Keyword

A single keyword may be set for a song in the
[Song&nbsp;Editor](en-Management-Song%20Editor). When a keyword is
set, the song will not be selected for automatic and sequenced
playlists unless the playlist has the keyword present in the _Allowed
Keywords_ list.

The common use of the keyword is to indicate holiday songs.  Songs
that are for holiday occasions have the keyword set to _holiday_.
These songs will be excluded from automatic and sequenced playlists
unless the playlist configuration allows the keyword.

Example of setting the keyword for a song:

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![keyword-song-editor](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/keyword-song-editor-A.png)
<br><span id="caption" style="color:#4559bf;">__Music Manager / Song Editor__</span> </div>

Example playlist settings for an automatic playlist that includes
holiday songs.  The _holiday_ keyword is added to
__Allowed&nbsp;Keywords__ to allow inclusion of these songs in the
automatic playlist.  In addition, the _holiday_ keyword is added to
__Tags__ and the __Tag&nbsp;Weight__ is set to 90 so that the holiday
songs will have a greater chance of being selected.
