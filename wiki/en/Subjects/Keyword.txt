<span style="color:#4559bf;">_A keyword is used to indicate a special
category and prevent the song from being selected for automatic and
sequenced playlists._</span>

### Keyword

A single keyword may be set for a song in the
[Song&nbsp;Editor](en-Management-Song%20Editor). When a keyword is
set, the song will not be selected for automatic and sequenced
playlists unless the playlist has the keyword present in the _Allowed
Keywords_ list.

The common use of the keyword is to indicate holiday songs.  Songs
that are for holiday occasions would have the keyword set.  These
songs will be excluded from automatic and sequenced playlists unless
the playlist configuration allows the keyword.

Example of setting the keyword for a song:

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![keyword-song-editor](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/keyword-song-editor-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Music Manager / Song Editor**</span> </div>

Example playlist settings for an automatic playlist that includes
holiday songs:

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![keyword-playlist](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/keyword-playlist-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Playlist Management**</span> </div>
