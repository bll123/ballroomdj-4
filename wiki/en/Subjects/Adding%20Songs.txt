### Adding Songs to the Database

After you have added new songs to your music collection, the
BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 database must be updated to include the new songs.

Select _Management_ from the _Starter_ window, then select the
[Update&nbsp;Database](en-Management-Update%20Database) section.

Select ___Check&nbsp;for&nbsp;New___ in the _Action_ selection (this is the
default).  Select the ___Start___ button.

BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 will check the music folder for new audio files.
When processing is complete, a _Complete_ messages will be displayed
in the processing status box.  The _New Files_ message will indicate
how many new audio files were added to the database.

##### Adding Songs in a Separate Folder

If you have audio files that are in a folder separate from your main
music folder (configured in BDJ4), use the directory chooser button
with the folder icon to select the alternate location for the
___Music&nbsp;Folder___ entry. Then start the
_Check&nbsp;for&nbsp;New_ action.
