### Create a Song List from a Playlist

A song list may be created from an automatic or sequenced playlist.
The song list can then be adjusted afterwards.  In the following
example, an automatic playlist is used to create a song list.

#### Create an Automatic Playlist

For this example, the automatic playlist will be set to have the
following dances with a count of 5: _Waltz_, _Foxtrot_, _Tango_.
_Rumba_, _Cha&nbsp;Cha_, _Jive_ and _Samba_ will added with a count of
3. _Viennese&nbsp;Waltz_ will be added with a count of 1.

The counts are relative to each other and are not absolute.  A dance
with a count of 5 will appear about 5 times more often than a dance
with a count of 1. A dance with a count of 3 will appear about 3/5 as
often as a dance with a count of 5.

[Management&nbsp;/&nbsp;Playlist&nbsp;Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management)
is used to set up the automatic playlist.

The automatic playlist will be named _example-auto_.  The maximum play
time will be set to 2:45.  The stop at time will be set to 22:00.  The
dance rating will be set to _Great_.  In addition, the maximum play
time for _Viennese&nbsp;Waltz_ will be set to 2:00.

#### Create a Song List Using the Automatic Playlist

Now switch to [Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists](en-Management-Edit%20Song%20Lists).
Select the __Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Create from Playlist__ menu item.

In the __Create&nbsp;from&nbsp;Playlist__ dialog, select
_example-auto_ in the playlist drop-down.  For the purposes of this
example, a time limit of thirty minutes is used.

<br><span id="caption" style="color:#4559bf;">__Edit Song Lists / Actions / Create from Playlist__</span> </div>

Rename the example song list to __example-create__.

#### Playlist Settings are Copied

The playlist settings from the automatic or sequenced playlist are
copied to the new song list.  The _Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time_,
_Stop&nbsp;At_, _Gap&nbsp;Between&nbsp;Songs_ and
_Play&nbsp;Announcements_ settings are copied from the automatic or
sequenced playlist to the created song list.

In addition, the _Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time_ settings for each dance is
also copied to the created song list.

#### Statistics

Looking at the statistics of the created song list, 60 songs were
added to the song list (the test songs used for this example are
short).  The percentages do not match because (a) 60 songs is not an
exact multiple of the total count (28) in the automatic playlist, and
(b) the dance selection is random, meaning that sometimes one dance or
another may show up a little more or a little less often.
