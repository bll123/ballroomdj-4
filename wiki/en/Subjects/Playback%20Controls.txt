### Playback Controls

In the [Song&nbsp;Editor](en-Management-Song%20Editor), the
Song&nbsp;Start, Song&nbsp;End, Speed&nbsp;Adjustment and
Volume&nbsp;Adjustment can be set for a song.

_Note that the fields displayed in the
[Song&nbsp;Editor](en-Management-Song%20Editor) can be changed in
[Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings)._

__Song&nbsp;Start__ is used to skip non-danceable or long introductory
music. _Song&nbsp;Start_ specifies the position to seek to before the
song starts playing.

__Song&nbsp;End__ is used to stop playback early when there is
non-danceable music near the end of the song or if there is a break in
the song that is not danceable.

_Song&nbsp;End_ specifies the ending position of the song.  The song
will end at the position specified. If the song's duration is longer
than the maximum play time, there is no need to set the
_Song&nbsp;End_.

If a fade-out is set, the fade will start before the song end
position.

__Speed&nbsp;Adjustment__ adjusts the playback speed.  When used with
the Integrated VLC player, the pitch is also automatically adjusted so
that the song's pitch sounds normal.

It is easier to set the _Song&nbsp;Start_ and _Song&nbsp;End_ before
making any speed adjustments.

__Volume&nbsp;Adjustment__ adjusts the volume during playback.  The
playback volume is adjusted by the set percentage during playback.
