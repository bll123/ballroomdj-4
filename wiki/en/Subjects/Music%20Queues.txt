<span style="color:#4559bf;">_Each music queue can be configured with
its own playback settings._</span>

[TOC]

### Music Queues

Each music queue can have the fade-in time, the fade-out time, the gap
between songs, the maximum play time, and the stop-at time configured.

In addition, each music queue can be set to pause each song, play
announcements, to play when the song is queued, and to show the extra
queue buttons.

Up to four music queues may be configured.

The music queue configuration options allow outstanding flexibility in
BallroomDJ&nbsp;4.

##### Displaying Music Queues in the Player

Start the player, and in the __Options__ menu, select the
__Show&nbsp;Extra&nbsp;Queues__ checkbox.

Any music queues that are configured to display will be displayed as a
notebook tab.  By default, the main music queue and _Queue B_ will
be displayed.

##### Configuring Music Queues

The music queues are configured in
__Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Music&nbsp;Queues__.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![musicq-conf-a](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/musicq-conf-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Configure / Music Queues**</span> </div>

If the __Active__ switch is off, the music queue inherits its
configuration from the main music queue.  There is no need to copy the
configuration from the main music queue or to make sure music queues
with the __Active__ switch off are updated when the main music queue
configuration is changed.

By default, _Queue&nbsp;B_ is set with the __Active__ switch off, so it
will have the same configuration as the main music queue.

The __Display__ switch should be turned on if you want the music
queue to display in the player.  By default, _Queue&nbsp;B_ is
displayed, and _Queue&nbsp;C_ and _Queue&nbsp;D_ are not displayed.

The __Queue&nbsp;Name__ can be changed to indicate what you use the
music queue for.

To configure a music queue with different settings than the main music
queue, turn on the __Active__ switch.  Then the fade-in time, fade-out
time, gap between songs, maximum play time and stop-at time can be
configured.

If the __Stop&nbsp;At__ time is set, the music will stop playing at
that time.  After the music stops, more songs may be queued, but it is
recommended that a second music queue be configured without no
__Stop&nbsp;At__ time set for situations (special parties, showcases)
where the music will play past the usual stop-at time. Note that a
playlist may also be configured with a stop-at time.

The __Pause&nbsp;Each&nbsp;Song__ switch is used for showcases and
other situations where more control is needed over when the song will
play.

The __Play&nbsp;Announcements__ switch will enable announcements for
all songs played with this music queue.

The __Play&nbsp;When&nbsp;Queued__ and
__Show&nbsp;Extra&nbsp;Queue&nbsp;Buttons__ are generally used for
teaching.  See the example below for a music queue set up for teaching.

##### Example: Setting up a Music Queue for Teaching

One possible setup for a music queue used for teaching could have the
fade-out time set to one second, the gap set to 0.5 seconds and the
maximum play time in this example is set high so that the entire song
will play.  The name of the music queue is set to "Teach".

The __Play&nbsp;When&nbsp;Queued__ and
__Show&nbsp;Extra&nbsp;QueueDance&nbsp;Buttons__ switches are turned on.
__Pause&nbsp;Each&nbsp;Song__ and __Play&nbsp;Announcements__ are off.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Configure / Music Queues**</span> </div>

As the queue dance buttons will be active, it is easy to quickly
select a dance using the _Queue&nbsp;Dance_ button (or five dances
with the _Queue&nbsp;5_ button) to add it to the queue (the song is
chosen at random) and start it playing.

__There is a special playlist named QueueDance (Nederlands:
DansToevoegen) that controls what songs are added to the queue by the
queue dance buttons__.  If you try this example, you may need to
adjust this special playlist to allow songs to be queued. (The
_Request_ tab can also be used to add songs to the music queue).

##### Using Music Queues in the Player

In the player, each music queue is displayed as a notebook tab.
Selecting a music queue allows you to manage that music queue.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![musicq-tabs-teach-a](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/musicq-tabs-teach-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Player : Music Queues**</span> </div>

In the __Request__ tab, the requests are queued to the last managed
music queue. The name of the last managed queue will be displayed next
to the __Queue__ button.  To change which music queue the request will
be queued to, select the music queue you want, then re-select the
_Request_ tab.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![musicq-req-b](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/musicq-req-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Player / Request**</span> </div>

The red light in the music queue tab indicates which music queue is
selected for playback.  Songs to play will be pulled from the music
queue that is selected for playback.  To change which queue is
selected for playback, select the music queue you want to play from,
and then select the __Set&nbsp;Queue&nbsp;for&nbsp;Playback__ button.

In the _Teach_ music queue example from above, close the player and
re-start the player.  Select the _Teach_ music queue.  Use the
__Queue&nbsp;Dance__ button and select a dance (or use the _Request_
tab to queue a song).  Since the _Teach_ music queue is not selected
for playback, the song is queued, but it will not play.

Now close the player and re-start the player again.  Select the
_Teach_ music queue. Select the
__Set&nbsp;Queue&nbsp;for&nbsp;Playback__ button to set the _Teach_
music queue for playback. Use the __Queue&nbsp;Dance__ button and
select a dance (or use the _Request_ tab to queue a song).  This time,
the song will start playing, as the __Play&nbsp;When&nbsp;Queued__
switch is on for the _Teach_ music queue.
