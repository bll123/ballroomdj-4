### Quick Edit

When using _Quick&nbsp;Edit_, be sure to give yourself enough time to
save the changes while the song is still playing or is still selected.
If the player finishes a song and moves to the next song, the changes
will not be saved.

#### Accessing Quick Edit

Quick Edit is accessed from the [Player's](en-Player-Player) _Actions_ menu.

__Quick&nbsp;Edit:&nbsp;Current__ will edit the currently playing song.

__Quick&nbsp;Edit:&nbsp;Selected__ will edit the currently selected
song in the music queue or the history.

#### Quick Edit: Current

When editing the current song, the _Speed&nbsp;Adjustment_ will be set
to the same speed as is set in the player. The _Volume&nbsp;Adjustment_
will automatically be set to the correct level based on the song's
volume&nbsp;adjustment setting and the current volume.

This is especially useful to adjust the volume of the song. As the
song is playing, set the volume of the player to adjust the volume of
the song to the appropriate level.  Then select
__Quick&nbsp;Edit:&nbsp;Current__ from the player's actions menu.  The
volume&nbsp;adjustment will be set correctly for the new volume.
Select the __Save__ button to save the changes. The player's volume will
be reset back to its current setting when the changes are saved.

#### Quick Edit: Selected

__Quick&nbsp;Edit:&nbsp;Selected__ will edit the song selected in the
music queue or in the history.  The song's current settings will be
loaded and displayed.  Make any changes and then select __Save__.

#### Configuring Which Fields are Displayed

The fields displayed in _Quick&nbsp;Edit_ can be configured in
[Configuration&nbsp;/&nbsp;Dialogs](en-Configuration-Dialogs).
