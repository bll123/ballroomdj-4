### Song Selection

Song selection uses various filters and weights to choose a song
from the available list of songs.

In order for song selection to work properly, the song must be
assigned a dance rating.

##### Song Filters

Song selection first filters out any songs based on the filters set in
the playlist.

See [Manage&nbsp;/&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Editor](en-Management-Song%20Editor)
to change the song's dance rating, dance level, keyword and status.

* Dance rating
<br>
The song must have a dance rating equal to or greater than the
playlist's dance rating setting.
<br>__References:__
<br>[Configure / Edit Ratings](en-Configuration-Edit%20Ratings)
* Dance level
<br>
Dance level is optional.  The default selections allow all songs.  When
in use, the song must have a dance level between the low and high
dance level settings.

<br>[Configure / Edit Levels](en-Configuration-Edit%20Levels)
* Keywords
<br>
Any song with a keyword set is rejected, unless the keyword is added
to the _Allowed&nbsp;Keywords_ setting in the playlist.
* Status
<br>
Status is optional.  If the status is in use, only those songs that
have a playable status are chosen.  The default status settings allow
all songs.

* Same Song Marks
<br>
If a song is are marked as the same song as another song, only one of
the songs with the same mark can be chosen.

##### Song Weights

Once the list of songs is filtered, a weight is assigned to each song
based on the dance rating's weight, the dance level's weight, and any
playlist tags.  A higher weight will cause the song to be more likely
to be chosen.

A song is then chosen from the list of available songs based on the
weight for each song.  e.g. If there were three songs, two with a
dance rating of _Good_ with a weight of 20 and one with a dance rating
of _Great_ with a weight of 80, then the song with the _Great_ dance
rating would have a 67% chance of being chosen, and the other two
songs would each have a 17% chance of being chosen.

If the dance level is not in use and no tags are set for the playlist,
these values will have no effect on song selection.

The dance rating is heavily weighted, and dance level and playlist
tags will not affect song selection as much as the dance rating.

The parameters that control song selection are documented in the
_data/autoselection.txt_ file.  If changes to these parameters are
desired, they must be changed manually.
