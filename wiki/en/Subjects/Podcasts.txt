### Podcasts

Podcasts can be imported into BDJ4.  A song list with the podcast
episodes will be created.

When BDJ4 starts, any podcasts that have been imported will be updated
with the latest episodes.

#### Importing a Podcast

Select __Manage&nbsp;/&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists__.  In the
_Import_ menu, select __Import&nbsp;Playlist__.

In the __Import&nbsp;From__ selection, select __Podcast__.

On the podcast web page, there will be a button to link to the
podcast.  "Walled Garden" podcasts such as Apple, Spotify, Amazon, etc.
are not supported.   Only a standard RSS podcast link is supported.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![podcast-links](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/podcast-links-A.png)
<br><span id="caption" style="color:#4559bf;">__Podcast Links__</span> </div>

The button can be dragged and dropped into the _Import&nbsp;Playlist_
dialog window.  Or right-click on the button in your web browser,
select "Copy Link", then right-click on the URL field in the
_Import&nbsp;Playlist_ dialog and select "Paste".

The _New&nbsp;Song&nbsp;List&nbsp;Name_ will be filled in using the
podcast name.  Change this name if desired.

For this example, the podcast
[But Why: A Podcast for Curious Kids](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/474377890/but-why-a-podcast-for-curious-kids)
will be used.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![podcast-import](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Subjects/podcast-import-B.png)
<br><span id="caption" style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Edit Song Lists / Import Playlist__</span> </div>

#### Checking the Connection

Select the __Check&nbsp;Connection__ button to check the configured
connection.  A status message will be displayed in the top right of
the window indicating success or failure.

#### Finishing the Import of the Podcast

Now select the __Import__ button in the __Import&nbsp;Playlist__ dialog.

Depending on how many episodes are in the podcast, the import may take
a while to finish, and for the new song list to display.  Be patient.

After the import is finished, a new song list with that podcast's
episodes will be displayed in _Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists_.

#### Managing the Podcast

Older podcast episodes can be automatically removed.

Select __Manage&nbsp;/&nbsp;Playlist&nbsp;Management__.  Select
__Load__ from the _Edit_ menu.  Select the podcast name, and then the
__Select__ button.

The __Days&nbsp;to&nbsp;Keep__ field can be configured to specify how
many days to keep a podcast episode.  A podcast episode older than the
number of days configured will be removed when the podcast is updated.
