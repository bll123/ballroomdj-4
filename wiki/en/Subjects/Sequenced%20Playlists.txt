[TOC]

### Sequenced Playlists

In a sequenced playlist, the dances to play are selected in a specific
order.  Once the end of the sequence is reached, the sequence starts
over again.  For each dance, BDJ4 will choose the song to play based on
various criteria.

In order for a sequenced playlist to work well, the songs should have
a [rating](en-Configuration-Edit&nbsp;Ratings) assigned to them.

##### Creating a Sequence

Select __Manage__ in the start window.  Select __Edit&nbsp;Sequences__.

Change the name of the sequence at the top of the window.

Select each dance to be played and use the right arrow button
![right](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/RightButton-B.png))
to add the dance to the sequence.

Use the up and down arrows to adjust the order of the dances in the
sequence.

The sequence will be saved automatically.

The _standardrounds_ sequence is pre-built and installed with BDJ4.

##### Song Selection

When a sequence is played, BDJ4 chooses the song from the songs filtered
by any playlist song selection filters.
<br>(See [Playlist Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management))

The song to be played is chosen based on the
[Dance&nbsp;Rating](en-Configuration-Edit%20Ratings) and
[Dance&nbsp;Level](en-Configuration-Edit%20Levels) (optional).

The dance rating and dance level have weights assigned to them that
adjust which song will be played.  A dance rating with a higher weight
will be played more often.  The dance rating is the primary selection
criteria.

In addition, same-song marks are checked to make sure that only one song
from those marked as the same song is used.

##### Playlist Controls

The sequence has an associated playlist.  If a sequence is loaded
in the song list editor, switching to the
[Playlist&nbsp;Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management) tab
will automatically load the associated playlist.

The _Settings_ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_ has the controls for
_Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time, _Stop&nbsp;At_, _Stop&nbsp;After_,
_Gap_ and _Play&nbsp;Announcements_.

The song filter associated with the playlist can also be changed in
thew _Settings_ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_.  The songs can
filtered by _Dance&nbsp;Rating_, _Dance&nbsp;Level_, and
_Allowed&nbsp;Keywords_.  In addition, in the _Dances_ tab, the songs
can be filtered by _Low&nbsp;MPM_ and _High&nbsp;MPM_ per dance.

In the _Dances_ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_, the maximum play
time for a particular dance can be set.
