### Sequenced Playlists

In a sequenced playlist, a list of dances to play is used. Once the
end of the sequence is reached, the sequence starts over again.  For
each dance, BDJ4 will choose the song to play based on various
criteria.

In order for a sequenced playlist to work well, the songs should have
a [rating](en-Configuration-Edit&nbsp;Ratings) assigned to them.

A sample _Standard&nbsp;Rounds_ sequence is installed with BDJ4.

##### Changing the Name of the Sequence

The sequence's name is at the top of the _Edit&nbsp;Sequence_ tab.
Enter the new name of the sequence playlist at any time.

On all platforms, the slash and backslash characters are not allowed
in sequence names.

On Windows, the following characters are not allowed in sequence names:
**&nbsp;*&nbsp;'&nbsp;"&nbsp;:&nbsp;|&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;^&nbsp;**

If you forget to change the name, the sequence will be named
_New&nbsp;Sequence_.  Select __Load__ from the __Edit__ menu.  Select
_New&nbsp;Sequence_.  Change the name of the sequence.

##### Creating a Sequence

Select __Manage__ in the start window.  Select __Edit&nbsp;Sequences__.
Select __Start&nbsp;New&nbsp;Sequence__ from the __Edit__ menu.

Change the name of the sequence at the top of the window.

Select each dance to be played and use the right arrow button
(![right](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/RightButton-B.png))
to add the dance to the sequence.

Use the up and down arrows to adjust the order of the dances in the
sequence.

The sequence will be saved automatically.

##### Song Selection

When a sequence is played, BDJ4 chooses the song from the songs filtered
by any playlist song selection filters.

<br>[Playlist&nbsp;Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management)

The song to be played is chosen based on the
[Dance&nbsp;Rating](en-Configuration-Edit%20Ratings) and
[Dance&nbsp;Level](en-Configuration-Edit%20Levels) (optional).

The dance rating and dance level have weights assigned to them that
adjust which song will be played.  A dance rating with a higher weight
will be played more often.  The dance rating is the primary selection
criteria.

In addition, same-song marks are checked to make sure that only one song
from those songs marked as the same song is used.

##### Playlist Controls

The sequence has an associated playlist.  If a sequence is loaded
in the song list editor, switching to the
[Playlist&nbsp;Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management) tab
will automatically load the associated playlist.

The _Settings_ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_ has the controls for
_Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time_, _Stop&nbsp;At_, _Stop&nbsp;After_,
_Gap_ and _Play&nbsp;Announcements_.

The song filter associated with the playlist can also be changed in
the _Settings_ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_.  The songs can
filtered by _Dance&nbsp;Rating_, _Dance&nbsp;Level_, and
_Allowed&nbsp;Keywords_.  In addition, in the _Dances_ tab, the songs
can be filtered by _Low&nbsp;MPM_ and _High&nbsp;MPM_ per dance.

In the _Dances_ tab in _Playlist&nbsp;Management_, the
_Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time_ for a particular dance can be set.
