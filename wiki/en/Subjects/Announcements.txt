### Announcements

Announcements are audio files that are associated with a dance.
Announcements may be turned on for a music queue or for a playlist.
The announcement associated with the song's assigned dance is played
before each song starts.

Announcements are useful when a marquee cannot be displayed in the
venue, and are also helpful if the marquee is not visible by all of
the dancers.

#### Adding the Announcements to the Database

First, the announcements must be added to the BallroomDJ&nbsp;4
database.  You can record your own announcements or find pre-recorded
announcements on the internet.
<br> (See: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/announcements/ )

Add the announcement audio file(s) to your music folder.  For the
purposes of this example, it will be assumed that the announcements
are named after the dance, and are stored in a folder named
"Announce".

Add the announcements to the BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 database using
__Manage&nbsp;/&nbsp;Update&nbsp;Database&nbsp;/&nbsp;Check&nbsp;for&nbsp;New__.
<br>(See
[Adding&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Database](en-Subjects-Adding%20Songs)).

#### Associate the Announcement with a Dance

Now, using __Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;Dances__, select the
dance to edit, select the __Announcement__ file chooser button with
the folder icon and select the announcement audio file for that dance.
If a dance does not have an announcement assigned, no announcement
will be played.

#### Playing Announcements

The announcement audio file(s) are now configured, but will not play
unless turned on for the music queue or the playlist.

If a music queue is configured to play announcements, all songs played
in that music queue will always have the announcement for the dance
played.  Since the music queue is set to always play an announcement,
any songs that should not have an announcement should be played from a
different music queue.

If a playlist is configured to play announcements, the songs from that
playlist will have the announcement for the dance played.  One
disadvantage of this method is that any requested songs added to the
queue will not have an announcement played (as there is no playlist
associated with the song added to the queue).

#### Configuring a Music Queue to Play Announcements

In __Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Music&nbsp;Queues__, turn on the
__Play&nbsp;Announcements__ switch.

#### Configuring a Playlist to Play Announcements

In __Manage&nbsp;/&nbsp;Playlist&nbsp;Management__, load the playlist to be
configured, and turn on the __Play&nbsp;Announcements__ switch.
