[TOC]

### Same Song Marks

Same song marks mark songs as the same so that the song selection
algorithm used in automatic and sequenced playlists will not choose
identical or similar songs to play.

For example, you may have the song _Sway_ by two different artists.
You want to keep both songs, as they are different, but you don't want
both songs to play during the same dance.

The same song mark color is chosen at random and will be different
every time BDJ4 is started.  The color cannot be set or changed.

##### Marking Songs as the Same

The [music manager](Management-Music%20Manager) is used to set the
same song marks on songs.  In the music manager, select the first
song, then select each additional song that you want to mark as the
same song by control-clicking (hold down the control key and left
mouse click) on each song.

Select __Mark&nbsp;as&nbsp;Same&nbsp;Song__ in the __Actions__ menu.

##### Adding Additional Songs to an Existing Set

If you already have a set of songs marked as the same song and you
want to add another song to the list, select one of the songs that is
already marked, then select the song to be added using control-click.
Select __Mark&nbsp;as&nbsp;Same&nbsp;Song__ in the __Actions__ menu.

When an song with an existing mark is in the list of selected songs,
any other songs that are not marked will be added to the same set of
songs with the existing mark and marked with the same color.

##### Clearing the Same Song Mark

To clear a same song mark from a song, select the songs to have their
mark cleared, then select __Clear&nbsp;Same&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Mark__ in
the __Actions__ menu.
