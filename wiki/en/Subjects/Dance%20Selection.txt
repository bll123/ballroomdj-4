### Dance Selection

Dance selection is a complicated algorithm designed to choose the next
dance to be played in an automatic playlist. The dance selection
algorithm is not perfect, but works pretty well.

Dance selection uses the following tests to determine which dance to
choose next.

* Dance.
<br>The dance is checked to see if it has been chosen recently.  The dance
selection algorithm attempts to spread each dance out evenly
throughout the playlist.
* Fast dances at the beginning of the playlist.
<br>Fast dances will not be chosen at the beginning of the playlist.
* Fast dances adjacent to each other.
<br>Fast dances played adjacent to each other are avoided.
* Type of dance.
<br>Dances adjacent to each other of the same type (standard/latin/club)
are avoided.
* Dance tags.
<br>Dances that are adjacent to each other or recently played and have
matching tags are avoided.  The tags for each dance can be changed to
help the dance selection algorithm avoid placing certain dances near
each other.

If all dances are rejected, the algorithm will make adjustments and
try to choose a dance again until a dance is chosen.

The type of dance and the dance tags can be set in
[Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;Dances](en-Configuration-Edit%20Dances).

The parameters that control dance selection are documented in the
_data/autoselection.txt_ file.  If changes to these parameters are
desired, they must be changed manually.
