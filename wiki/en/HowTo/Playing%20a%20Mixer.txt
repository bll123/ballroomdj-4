### How To : Playing a Mixer

One common ballroom dance situation is playing a mixer during the
dance.  The mixer can be inserted directly into the playlist, but the
current music queue's configuration may not be appropriate for a mixer
(fade-out, gap, play announcements).

The example below outlines one method for playing a mixer.

##### Configuring a Music Queue for a Mixer

For the mixer music queue, in
__Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Music&nbsp;Queues__, use the selector to
choose a new music queue.  Change the name of the music queue to
_Mixer_.  Change the __Active__ selection to on. Set the
__Gap&nbsp;Between&nbsp;Songs__ to 0.0, and use a fast fade-out time.
Also make sure __Play&nbsp;Announcements__ is off.  For this example
the __Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time__ is set to 1:30 minutes.

Close the configuration window to save the configuration changes.

##### Creating an Automatic Playlist for the Mixer

If you always use the same dance for your mixer, setting up an
automatic playlist for the mixer can save some work.  Otherwise, skip
to the [Turn on the Extra Queues](#turn-on-the-extra-queues) step.

In __Manage&nbsp;/&nbsp;Playlist&nbsp;Management__, select
__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;New&nbsp;Automatic&nbsp;Playlist__ from the menu.
Change the name of the playlist to _Waltz&nbsp;Mixer_.  Set
__Stop&nbsp;After__ to 4.  Set __Dance&nbsp;Rating__ to _Great_.
In the _Dances_ tab, select _Waltz_, click on the
__Count__ for _Waltz_, and set the count to 1.

Be aware that to use an automatic playlist, the dance rating for each
song must be set.
<br>(See: [Automatic Playlists](en-Subjects-Automatic-Playlists))

##### Turn on the Extra Queues

In the __Player__, open the __Options__ menu, and turn on
__Show&nbsp;Extra&nbsp;Queues__ and
__Switch&nbsp;Queue&nbsp;When&nbsp;Empty__.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Player / Options__</span> </div>

##### Start the Dance

In the __Player__, select the main music queue and use the
__Queue&nbsp;Playlist__ button to queue the regular playlist for the
dance. Use the __Play&nbsp;/&nbsp;Pause__
(![b-pp](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/player-b-playpause-A.png))
button to start the dance.

##### Adding Songs for the Mixer

If you always use the same dance for your mixer, see [Creating an
Automatic Playlist for the
Mixer](#creating-an-automatic-playlist-for-the-mixer) for an
alternative.

A) If you are using an automatic playlist as outlined above:

In the __Player__, select the ___Mixer___
music queue and use the __Queue&nbsp;Playlist__ button to queue the
_Waltz&nbsp;Mixer_ playlist that was created for this example.

B) If you are not using an automatic playlist:

In the __Player__, first select the ___Mixer___ music queue.

Next, select the __Request__ tab.  Note that the label next to the
___Queue___ button now displays ___Mixer___.  This is the queue to
which the songs will be added.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Player / Request__</span> </div>

Use the filter button
(![b-filter](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/FilterSongsButton-A.png))
and select the dance and rating you want to play.  Select the
__Apply__ button.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Player / Request / Filter__</span> </div>

For each song you want to play for the mixer, select the song, then select the
__Queue__ button.

##### Playing the Mixer

When you are ready to play the mixer, select the
__Pause&nbsp;at&nbsp;End__ button.

Select the ___Mixer___ music queue, and
select the __Set&nbsp;Queue&nbsp;for&nbsp;Playback__ button.  The
selection light for the ___Mixer___ queue will be lit.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Player__</span> </div>

When the
music stops playing, make the mixer announcement, then select the
__Play&nbsp;/&nbsp;Pause__
(![b-pp](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/player-b-playpause-A.png))
button to start the music playing.  When the mixer has finished,
playback will automatically switch back to the main music queue, and
playback will continue from the main music queue.
