### External Requests

An external request adds a song that is not in the database to the
music queue.

##### Playing a song that is not in the database.

In the [Player](en-Player-Player), first select the music queue that
the song will be added to.  The external request will be added to the
queue after the currently selected song.  Select the song where
the external request will be added.

Now select __External&nbsp;Request__ in the __Actions__ menu.  The
external request dialog will open.

Use the folder icon to open the file selection dialog.  Navigate to
the desired folder, and select the audio file to add to the queue.
The audio file's information will be loaded if possible, and the
artist and title will be displayed.

If desired, edit the artist and title information.  Also select the
dance as appropriate.  The _Marquee&nbsp;Display_ field may be set, and
will display instead of the dance.

If the __No&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time&nbsp;Limit__ switch is turned on the
entire song will be played.  Otherwise the play time may be limited by
the music queue settings.

Select the __Queue__ button to queue the song.
