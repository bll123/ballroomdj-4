<span style="color:#4559bf;">_Reload reloads the music queues, history
and current song to the last known state._</span>

### Reload

If the player is accidentally exited, the computer must be rebooted,
or BDJ4 becomes unstable and must be re-started, the
_Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Reload_ menu selection will reload the music
queues, the history and the currently playing song from the last saved
state.

In the player, every time a music queue, history or the currently
playing song is changed, the music queues, history queue and current
song will be automatically saved.

When the player is first started, the _Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Reload_
menu selection is active.  After any change to the music queue, the
_Reload_ menu selection is disabled and can no longer be used.

Selecting __Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Reload__ will load the music queues,
the history queue and the current playing song from the last save.

##### Reload and Automatic or Sequenced Playlists

When an automatic or sequenced playlist is queued, the reload process
will only reload the songs that were in the music queue.  The
automatic or sequenced playlist is not re-queued.

Wait until after several songs in the music queue have been played, then
queue the automatic or sequenced playlist again.  Scroll to the end of
the music queue and adjust the songs in the queue if needed.

##### Reload and Playlist Controls

When __Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Reload__ is used, any playlist controls
from the original playlist will no longer be active.
