<span style="color:#4559bf;">_The marquee is used to display a list
of upcoming songs._</span>

### Marquee

If the marquee cannot be displayed with a projector or on a monitor,
consider using announcements
([Subjects&nbsp;/&nbsp;Announcements](en-Subjects-Announcements)) or
the mobile marquee
([Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Mobile&nbsp;Marquee](en-Configuration-Mobile%20Marquee))
so that the dancers know which songs will be played next.

Move the marquee window to the monitor where it will be displayed. The
font size can be adjusted using the player's
[Marquee&nbsp;/&nbsp;Font&nbsp;Size](https://sourceforge.net/p/ballroomdj4/wiki/en-Player-Player/#marquee-menu)
menu selection.

Double-clicking inside the marquee window will maximize the marquee
window to fill the screen.  Double-clicking again will return the
marquee to its previous size.

Each time the marquee is started, BDJ4 will attempt to position and
size the marquee window where it was before.

If the _Show&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Information_ selection is turned on
([Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Marquee](en-Configuration-Marquee)), the current
playing song's information is displayed.  The song information that is
displayed can be changed in
[Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings)
using the _Marquee_ selection.
