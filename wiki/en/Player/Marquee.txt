### Marquee

If the marquee cannot be displayed with a projector or on a monitor,
consider using announcements or the mobile marquee
([Configuration&nbsp;/&nbsp;Mobile%20Marquee](en-Configuration-Mobile%20Marquee))
so that the dancers know which songs will be played next.

Move the marquee window to the monitor where it will be displayed. The
font size can be adjusted using the player's
[Marquee&nbsp;/&nbsp;Font&nbsp;Size](https://sourceforge.net/p/ballroomdj4/wiki/en-Player-Player/#marquee-menu)
menu selection.

Double-clicking inside the marquee window will maximize the marquee
window to fill the screen.  Double-clicking again will return the
marquee to its previous size.

Each time the marquee is started, BDJ4 will attempt to position and
size the marquee window where it was before.
