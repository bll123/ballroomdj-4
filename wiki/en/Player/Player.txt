<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Player / Player Display**</span> </div>

The left side of the player display includes the player status, repeat
status, dance, artist and title display, time remaining to play, total
duration of the song, and the buttons to control the player.

The right side of the player display includes the speed, song position
and volume sliders.

the song.  The time played is displayed to the right of the position
slider.

##### Player Controls

the music queue will start playing.

___Play / Pause___:

and no gap applied.  If the player is playing, the next song will
start playing.  The next song button may be used when the player is
paused or stopped.

player will stop playing after the song finishes.
