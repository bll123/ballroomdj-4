The left side of the player display includes the player status, repeat
status, dance, artist and title display, time remaining to play, total
duration of the song, and the buttons to control the player.

The right side of the player display includes the speed, song position

##### Player Controls

the music queue will start playing.

toggle is turned on, and the song will finish playing.

and no gap applied.  If the player is playing, the next song will
start playing.  The next song button may be used when the player is
paused or stopped.

player will stop playing after the song finishes.
