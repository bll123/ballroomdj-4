### Differences between BallroomDJ 3 and BallroomDJ 4

As of 2022-12-01:

At this time the supported platforms for BallroomDJ 4 will probably be:

* 64-bit Windows 10, 11
* MacOS intel: Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura
* MacOS M1: Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura
* 64-bit Linux

__Features that will NOT be implemented in BallroomDJ&nbsp;4:__

* Synchronization between computers.
* Client/Server mode.
* Image display.
* Playlist: Required Keywords.
* Playlist: Marquee message.
* Player: Marquee message.
* Player: Changing the gap dynamically.
* Mobile Marquee: internet mode.
* Built-in Help
<br>Keeping two help sources up to date (built-in and wiki) is difficult.
I prefer to only have one.  Only the wiki will be be supported.
* Windows 7 will not be supported.  The tools I use are dropping
support for old versions of Windows.
* File Manager.
<br>This functionality has been moved into the song list/playlist/sequence
editors and the starter user interface.
Renaming playlists is much simpler.
* Raffle Games.
* New Years Countdown.
* Analog Clock.

__Features that have changed in BallroomDJ&nbsp;4:__

* Playlist: Stop In/At <time> pause/continue.
<br>__BDJ4 only supports: Stop At <time>__
* Playlist: Stop After <song-count> pause/continue.
<br>__BDJ4 only supports: Stop After <song-count>__
* Playlist: Pause after each song.
<br>__BDJ4 has a pause each song switch in the player per-queue configuration.__
* Auto Organization
<br>BDJ4 has no auto organization path editor.   To add a new path, the
configuration file (data/orgopt.txt) must be manually edited. (If the
organization path you currently use is not already in the
configuration file, it is automatically added during the BDJ3 to BDJ4
conversion process).
<br>BDJ4 drops the "various artists" flag and settings.
<br>BDJ4 drops the "change spaces to underscores" option.
<br>BDJ4 has a single auto organization path (rather than four).  Some
rules are applied to make it work nicely.
    * Composer and conductor groups will only be added if the genre is
marked as classical.
    * The composer group will be omitted if the composer is the same as
the album artist or the artist.
    * If the album artist is empty, it uses the artist data.
    * If both the album artist and the artist are in the auto
organization path and they are the same, the artist group is omitted.

Due to the changes in auto organization, the BDJ3 to BDJ4 conversion
process will always turn off auto organization in the BDJ4
configuration.

I don't want anyone to accidentally run a reorganization in BDJ4 and
then discover that their BallroomDJ 3 no longer works since the audio
files have been renamed.

__New Features:__

* "Stop At" time has been added to the player configuration.
<br>This stop at time will apply to all music played using the associated
profile.
* "Play Announcements" has been added to the player per-queue
configuration.
* Switch playback to another music queue when the current music
queue is empty.
* An optional easy song list editing mode.
<br>The disadvantage being that it cannot show as much information on
screen.
It's easy to switch back and forth between the two modes.
* A favorite selection.  This can be used to mark requests, songs
that are good for teaching, etc.
* New installation getting-started helper.  A short walk through of
the basic settings needed to get started.
This starts up automatically when BDJ4 is started for new installations.
* Folders other than the music folder may be specified in the
database update process.  This allows multiple music folder locations.
* Writing audio file tags is no longer limited to FLAC, MP3 and
Ogg-Vorbis.
Currently supported for MP4 (.m4a), MP3, OGG/Vorbis, FLAC, OGG/Opus.
Others may be added later.
* Per queue configuration (fade in time, fade out time, maximum play
time, play announcements, pause each song).

Other than these major changes, I am trying to greatly simply the
configuration (while keeping the flexibility), combine things where
possible, etc.

As always if you have questions, post a message here in the forums.
BDJ4 is still in development and anything can change.

__Questions & Answers__

__Q:__ Is there any advantage to starting with a fresh install
rather than using the BDJ3 to BDJ4 conversion process? (1)

__A:__ No.  The BDJ3 to BDJ4 conversion process is quite robust,
and there are no issues with using it.
The conversion process will convert all of your BallroomDJ 3 data
files (warts and all).
The only reason to do a fresh install would be if you want to change
locales (e.g. English to Nederlands).

__Q:__ Will installing BDJ4 affect my BallroomDJ 3 installation? (1)

__A:__ No.  BallroomDJ 4 is installed in a separate folder and the
conversion process creates new files specifically for BDJ4.
The only configuration options that could affect the audio files are
"Auto Organization" (not implemented yet) and "Write BallroomDJ Tags"
(the conversion process turns this off, and also the 'write BDJ3
compatible audio file tags' is turned on).

(1) No one actually asked this, but I thought you might like to know.
