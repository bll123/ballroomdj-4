_Delete_
(![Delete](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DeleteButton-E.png))
button to remove the dance.

configuration.

___Dance___: The name of the dance. ___Note that changing the name of
dance that is already in your database will cause many problems.___

___Type___: The type is used for automatic playlists.  Dances with
the same type are not as likely to be next to another dance of the
same type.

___Speed___: The speed is used for automatic playlists.  Fast dances are
not placed at the very beginning of the playlist, and fast dances are
not as likely to be next to another fast dance.

___Tags___: Tags are used for automatic playlists.  Dances with matching
tags are not as likely to be next to each other.

___Announcement___: The announcement played before the dance is played.
Note that the announcement audio files must be in the database.

___Low BPM___: This is a display option for use in the song editor.
__This is not currently implemented.__

___High BPM___: This is a display option for use in the song editor.
__This is not currently implemented.__

___Time Signature___: This is used by the BPM counter to select the
proper default when MPM is selected in the
[General&nbsp;Options](en-Configuration-General).
