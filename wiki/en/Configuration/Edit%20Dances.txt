### Configuration : Edit Dances

__Edit Dances__ configures the dances that are known to BDJ4.  Dances
can be added or removed and the configuration for each dance changed.

Adding a new dance:  Select the __&#43;__ button to add a new dance.
The dance is added with a default name of _New&nbsp;Dance_.  Change the
name of the dance to what you want.

Removing a dance: Select the dance to remove in the list.  Select the
_Delete_ button to remove the dance.

Modifying a dance: Select the dance to change and change the dance
configuration.

__Dance__: The name of the dance. ___Note that changing the name of
dance that is already in your database will cause many problems.___

__Type__: The type is used for automatic playlists.  Dances with
the same type are not as likely to be next to another dance of the
same type.

__Speed__: The speed is used for automatic playlists.  Fast dances are
not placed at the very beginning of the playlist, and fast dances are
not as likely to be next to another fast dance.

__Tags__: Tags are used for automatic playlists.  Dances with matching
tags are not as likely to be next to each other.

__Announcement__: The announcement played before the dance is played.
Note that the announcement audio files must be in the database.

__Low BPM__: This is a display option for use in the song editor.
__This is not currently implemented.__

__High BPM__: This is a display option for use in the song editor.
__This is not currently implemented.__

__Time Signature__: This is used by the BPM counter to select the
proper default when MPM is selected in the
[General&nbsp;Options](en-Configuration-General).
