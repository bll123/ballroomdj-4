in automatic and sequenced playlists._</span>

### Configure : Edit Levels

The dance level can be used to help filter songs according to their
difficulty.  If you want to use levels, you will also want to change
the [Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings).

Dance levels should be ordered from the easiest to the most advanced.

The __Weight__ is used by the automatic and sequenced song selection to
adjust which songs are used.  A higher level weight will make a song
more likely to play.  Select the level, then click on the weight to
change the weight.

The __Default__ selection determines which dance level is assigned to
songs that do not have a dance level set.

Adding a new level, select the __Add&nbsp;New__ (![Add
New](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/AddNewButton-E.png))
button.  Click on the name to change the name.

Use the up and down arrows
(![move-up](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/UpButton-B.png),
![move-down](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DownButton-B.png))
to move the level to the position you want.

Select the __Delete__
(![Delete](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DeleteButton-E.png))
button to delete a level.
