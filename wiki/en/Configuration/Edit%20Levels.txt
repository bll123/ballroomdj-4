### Configuration : Edit Levels

<span style="color:#4559bf;">_Dance levels are optional and are used
in automatic and sequenced playlists._</span>

The dance level can be used to help filter songs according to their
difficulty.   If you want to use levels, you will also want to change
the
[Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings).

Levels should be ordered from the easiest to the most advanced.

To add a new level, select the _Add New_ (![Add
New](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/AddNewButton-E.png))
button.  Then click on the name to change the name. Use the up and
down arrows
(![move-up](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/UpButton-B.png),
![move-down](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DownButton-B.png))
to move the level to the position you want. Select the _Delete_
(![Delete](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DeleteButton-E.png))
button to delete a level.

The _Weight_ is used by the automatic and sequenced song selection to
adjust which songs are used.  A higher level weight will make a song
more likely to play.  Select the level, then click on the weight to
change the weight.

The _Default_ selection determines which dance level is assigned to
songs that do not have a dance level set.
