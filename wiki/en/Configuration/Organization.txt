files are stored on your computer._</span>

### Configure : Organization

The organization path is used when the audio file is added to the
database and for automatic organization of the audio files.

When the audio file is added to the database, the organization path
can be used to help determine the dance for that song and also the
title of the song if the _Title_ audio tag is not set. For example, if
the organization path is set to _Dance/Title_, and the audio file on
disk is _Waltz/The Last Waltz_, then the dance will be set to _Waltz_
and the title to _The Last Waltz_.

Many different organization paths can be supported.  Ask for help if
you have an organization path that is not in the default list.

__Database Loads Dance from Genre__: Used when the song's genre is set
to the dance. Enabling this option will try to set the dance from the
song's genre field.

__Auto Organize__: When enabled, the audio files are renamed to match
the organization path.
