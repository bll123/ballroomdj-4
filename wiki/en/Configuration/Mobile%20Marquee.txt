### Configure : Mobile Marquee

The mobile marquee is a web page that displays the upcoming songs on a
mobile phone or tablet.

This is useful for venues where the marquee cannot be displayed or is
not readily visible from all parts of the room.

There are two modes: Local and Internet.

For _Local_ mode, the computer running BDJ4 must be connected
to a Wi&#8209;Fi network, but does not need to be connected to the
internet.

The _Internet_ mode is useful when there is already an existing
Wi&#8209;Fi network.

__Type__: Select one of _Off_, _Local_, or _Internet_.
The mobile marquee is activated when then player is started.

__Tag__: _Internet_ mode only.  A unique tag to identify your ballroom
or group.  Add some information that uniquely identifies your ballroom
or group, such as the city and state or province.  e.g.
_danceacademy_ is a bad tag.  _danceacademybrusselsbe_ is better.

__Password__: _Internet_ mode only.  The password for the internet
mobile marquee.  The password prevents anyone else from using the tag
you selected.  Once set, it cannot be changed.  The password is set
permanently the first time the mobile marquee is started by the
player.

__Port__: _Local_ mode only.  The port to connect to.  This usually
does not need to be changed unless there is another device using this
port.  Ports below 1024 are reserved and cannot be used by BDJ4.

__Title__: An optional title to display on the mobile marquee.

__QR Code__: Select the link to display a QR code in your browser. The
QR code can be copied from the browser and embedded in a document to
be printed out so that the dancers can scan the QR Code. (The link
will show your computer's name, not what is shown in the example).
