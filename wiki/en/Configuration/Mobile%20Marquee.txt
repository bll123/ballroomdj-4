### Configure : Mobile Marquee

The mobile marquee is a web page that displays the upcoming songs on a
mobile phone or tablet.  The computer running BDJ4 must be connected
to a Wi&#8209;Fi network, but does not need to be connected to the
internet.

This is useful for venues where the marquee cannot be displayed or is
not readily visible from all parts of the room.

__Enable Mobile Marquee__: Turns on the mobile marquee.  The mobile
marquee is activated when then player is started.

__Title__: An optional title to display on the mobile marquee.

__Port__: The port to connect to.  This usually does not need to be
changed unless there is another device using this port.

__QR Code__: Select the link to display a QR code in your browser. The
QR code can be copied from the browser and embedded in a document to
be printed out so that the dancers can scan the QR Code. (The link
will show your computer's name, not what is shown in the example).
