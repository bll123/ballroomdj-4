### Configuration : Mobile Marquee

The mobile marquee is a web page that displays the upcoming songs on a
mobile phone or tablet.  The computer running BDJ4 must be connected
to a Wi-Fi network (but does not need to be connected to the internet).

This is useful for venues where the marquee cannot be displayed.

__Enable Mobile Marquee__: Turns on the mobile marquee. (activated
when then player is started).

__Title__: An optional title to display on the mobile marquee.

__Port__: The port to connect to.  This usually does not need to be
changed unless there is another device using this port.

__QR Code__: Select the link to display a QR code that can be scanned
with a mobile phone or tablet.  This can be copied from the browser
and embedded in a document to be printed out so that the dancers can
scan the QR Code.
