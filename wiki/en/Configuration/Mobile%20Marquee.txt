### Configuration : Mobile Marquee

<span style="color:#4559bf;">_The mobile marquee will display the
upcoming songs on a mobile device._</span>

The mobile marquee is a web page that displays the upcoming songs on a
mobile phone or tablet.  The computer running BDJ4 must be connected
to a Wi&#8209;Fi network, but does not need to be connected to the
internet.

This is useful for venues where the marquee cannot be displayed.

___Enable Mobile Marquee___: Turns on the mobile marquee. (activated
when then player is started).

___Title___: An optional title to display on the mobile marquee.

___Port___: The port to connect to.  This usually does not need to be
changed unless there is another device using this port.

___QR Code___: Select the link to display a QR code in your browser. The
QR code can be copied from the browser and embedded in a document to
be printed out so that the dancers can scan the QR Code.
