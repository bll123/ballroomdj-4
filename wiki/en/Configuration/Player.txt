### Configuration : Player Options

The player options provides settings that control how the player works.

The __Player_ and __Audio__ settings generally do not change.

__Audio Output__: Selects which audio output device will be used to
play the audio.  If the selected device is not currently connected,
the default device will be used.

__Default Volume__: Sets the volume level when BDJ4 first starts.

__Stop At__: The time when playback stops.  As this is a global
setting and affects all playlists, a second profile would need to be
set up for other use cases (showcases, parties).  See also the
__Stop At__ capabilities
in [Playlist Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management).

__Queue Length__: The number of songs the music queue is filled with.

__Completion Message__: A message displayed on the marquee when the dance
is finished (no more songs left to play, or a stop condition has been
met).

__Queue__: Selects which music queue to configure.  The following settings
apply to the selected music queue.

__Queue Name__: The name displayed for this music queue.

__Active__: Whether the settings for the music queue are active.  When
off, the settings for the main music queue are used (other than
__Display__).

__Display__: Whether this music queue will be displayed when the
__Show Extra Queues__ option is turned on in the player.

__Fade In Time__: The amount of time used to fade in the volume when the
song starts playing.  Set to 0.0 for no fade in.

__Fade Out Time__:  The amount of time used to fade out the volume when
song ends.  If the song ends before the fade out would normally start,
no fade out is applied.  Set to 0.0 for no fade out.

__Maximum Play Time__: The maximum duration a song will play.  This is
often set anywhere from 2:00 minutes to 3:00 minutes.  Set to 0:00 to
turn off entirely.

__Pause Each Song__: Playback will pause after each song is played.  This
setting is used for showcases and events.

__Play Announcements__: The dance announcement will be played before each
song.  See [Edit Dances](en-Configuration-Edit%20Dances).
