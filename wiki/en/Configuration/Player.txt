### Configuration : Player Options

<span style="color:#4559bf;">_Player options provides settings
that control how the player works.</span>

The __Player__ and __Audio__ settings generally do not change.

__Audio Output__: Selects which audio output device will be used to
play the audio.  If the selected device is not currently connected,
the default device will be used.

__Default Volume__: Sets the volume level when BDJ4 first starts.

__Stop At__: The time when playback stops.  As this is a global
setting and affects all playlists, a second profile would need to be
set up for other use cases (showcases, parties).  See also the __Stop
At__ capabilities in
[Playlist&nbsp;Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management).

__Queue Length__: The number of songs the music queue is filled with.

__Completion Message__: A message displayed on the marquee when the dance
is finished (no more songs left to play).

__Queue__: Selects which music queue to configure.  The following settings
apply to the selected music queue.

__Queue Name__: (per-queue) The name displayed for this music queue.

__Active__: (per-queue) Whether the settings for the music queue are
active.  When off, the settings for the main music queue are used
(other than __Display__).

__Display__: (per-queue) Whether this music queue will be displayed
when the __Show&nbsp;Extra&nbsp;Queues__ option is turned on in the
player.

__Fade In Time__: (per-queue) The amount of time used to fade in the
volume when the song starts playing.  Set to 0.0 for no fade in.

__Fade Out Time__: (per-queue) The amount of time used to fade out the
volume when song ends.  If the song ends before the fade out would
normally start, no fade out is applied.  Set to 0.0 for no fade out.

__Gap__: (per-queue) The amount of time to wait before playing the
next song.

__Maximum Play Time__: (per-queue) The maximum duration a song will
play.  This is often set anywhere from 2:00 minutes to 3:00 minutes.
Set to 0:00 to turn off entirely. See also
[Playlist&nbsp;Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management)

__Pause Each Song__: (per-queue) Playback will pause after each song
is played.  This setting is used for showcases and events.

__Play Announcements__: (per-queue) The dance announcement will be
played before each song. See
[Edit&nbsp;Dances](en-Configuration-Edit%20Dances).

__Show Queue Dance Buttons__: (per-queue) Show the _Queue&nbsp;Dance_
and _Queue&nbsp;5_ buttons.  These are used for teaching.
