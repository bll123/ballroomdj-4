### Configure : Player

The __Player__ and __Audio__ settings usually do not change.

__Player__: Selects the player interface.  At this time, only
_Integrated&nbsp;VLC_ is supported.

__Audio__: Selects the audio interface.

__Audio Output__: Selects which audio output device will be used to
play the audio.  If the selected device is not currently connected,
the default device will be used.

__Queue Length__: The number of songs the music queue is filled with.

__Completion Message__: A message displayed on the marquee when the dance
