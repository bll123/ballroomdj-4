### Configure : Player

The __Player__ and __Audio__ settings usually do not change.

__Player__: Selects the player interface.  At this time,
_Integrated&nbsp;VLC&nbsp;3_ and _GStreamer_ are supported.  The _GStreamer_
interface is currently only enabled for Linux platforms.

__Audio__: Selects the audio interface.

__Audio Output__: Selects which audio output device will be used to
play the audio.  If the selected device is not currently connected,
the default device will be used.

__Default Volume__: Sets the volume level when BDJ4 first starts.

__Queue Length__: The number of songs the music queue is filled with.

__Completion Message__: A message displayed on the marquee when the dance
is finished (no more songs left to play).

__Show Speed Reset__: The 'Reset Speed to 100%' button will be
displayed in the player.
