<span style="color:#4559bf;">_Dance ratings are used in automatic and
sequenced song selection._</span>

### Configure : Edit Ratings

The _Unrated_ rating may not be removed or moved and is assigned to
any song without a rating.

The ratings should be ordered from the lowest rating to the highest
rating.

The __Weight__ is used by the automatic and sequenced song selection to
adjust which songs are used.  A weight of zero will prevent a song
with that rating from being selected.  A higher rating weight will
make a song more likely to play.

Added a new rating: Select the __Add&nbsp;New__ (![Add
New](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/AddNewButton-E.png))
button to add a new rating. Click on the name of the new rating to
change the name.  Then click on the weight to set the weight.  Use the
up and down arrows
(![move-up](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/UpButton-B.png),
![move-down](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DownButton-B.png))
to move the rating to its correct position.

Removing a rating: Select the rating and select the __Delete__
(![Delete](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DeleteButton-E.png))
button.

Modifying a rating: Select the rating, then click on the name or
weight to change it.
