### Configuration : Edit Status

The status field can be used to track the status of songs in the
database.  If you want to use the status field, you will probably
also want to change
the [Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings).

The _New_ and _Complete_ statuses may not be removed or have their
names changed.

To add a new status, select the __+__ button.  Then double-click on
the status name to edit the name.  Use the up and down arrows to
adjust the order in which they appear.  Use the delete button to
remove a status.

The __Play?__ selection indicates whether the song will be used in
automatic or sequenced playlists and whether it will show up in the
request selection.
