### Configuration : Edit Status

<span style="color:#4559bf;">_Status is optional and can be used to
track the status of songs._</span>

The status field can be used to track the status of songs in the
database.  If you want to use the status field, you will also want to
change the
[Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings).

The _New_ and _Complete_ statuses may not be removed or have their
names changed.  Songs newly added to the database are assigned the
_New_ status.

To add a new status, select the _Add New_ (![Add
New](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/AddNewButton-C.png))
button.  Then double-click on the status name to edit the name.  Use
the up and down arrows to adjust the order in which the statuses
appear.  Use the _Delete_
(![Delete](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DeleteButton-C.png))
button to remove a status.

The __Play?__ selection indicates whether the song will be used in
automatic or sequenced playlists and whether it will show up in the
request selection.  This selection corresponds to the
_Playable&nbsp;Status_ filter (see:
[Filter&nbsp;Display](en-Configuration-Filter%20Display).
