control BDJ4 from your mobile device._</span>

### Configure : Mobile Remote Control

Mobile Remote Control is a web page that can be used to control BDJ4
over the Wi&#8209;Fi network.  Access the web page via your mobile phone or
tablet.  The computer running BDJ4 must be connected to a Wi&#8209;Fi
network, but does not need to be connected to the internet.

__Enable Remote Control__: Turns on the remote control function.
Mobile remote control is activated when the player is started.

__HTML Template__: Select the style (and language) of web page to
display.

__User ID__: The user ID to use when signing on to the remote control
web page.

__Password__: The password to use when signing on to the remote
control web page.

__Port__: The port to connect to.  This usually does not need to be
changed unless there is another device using this port.

__QR Code__: Select the link to display a QR code in your browser. The
QR code can be scanned with your mobile phone or tablet. (The link
will show your computer's name, not what is shown in the example).
