### Configuration : Mobile Remote Control

<span style="color:#4559bf;">_Mobile Remote Control can be used to
control BDJ4 from your mobile device._</span>

Mobile Remote Control is a web page that can be used to control BDJ4
over the Wi&#8209;Fi network.  Access the web page via your mobile phone or
tablet.  The computer running BDJ4 must be connected to a Wi&#8209;Fi
network, but does not need to be connected to the internet.

__Enable Remote Control__: Turns on the remote control function.
Mobile remote control is activated when the player is started.

__HTML Template__: Select the style (and language) of web page to
display.

__User ID__: The user ID to use when signing on to the remote control
web page.

__Password__: The password to use when signing on to the remote
control web page.

__IP Address__: The local IP address.  If the computer is connected to
the internet, this field will automatically be filled in.

If the computer is not connected to the internet, enter the computer's
local IP address.

If the IP address has already been set, it will not be replaced.  If
the computer is connected to the internet and you want to reset it,
blank out the field, then turn _Enable&nbsp;Remote&nbsp;Control_ off
and on again.

__Port__: The port to connect to.  This usually does not need to be
changed unless there is another device using this port.

__QR Code__: Select the link to display a QR code in your browser.
The QR code can be scanned with your mobile phone or tablet.
