control BDJ4 from your mobile device._</span>

### Configure : Mobile Remote Control

Mobile Remote Control is a web page that can be used to control BDJ4
over the Wi&#8209;Fi network.  Access the web page via your mobile phone or
tablet.  The computer running BDJ4 must be connected to a Wi&#8209;Fi
network, but does not need to be connected to the internet.

__Enable Remote Control__: Turns on the remote control function.
Mobile remote control is activated when the player is started.

__HTML Template__: Select the style (and language) of web page to
display.

__User ID__: The user ID to use when signing on to the remote control
web page.

__Password__: The password to use when signing on to the remote
control web page.

__Port__: The port to connect to.  This usually does not need to be
changed unless there is another device using this port.  Ports below
1024 are reserved and cannot be used by BDJ4.

__QR Code__: Select the link to display a QR code in your browser. The
QR code can be scanned with your mobile phone or tablet. (The link
will show your computer's name, not what is shown in the example).
