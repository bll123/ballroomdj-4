### Known Issues

* General
    * BDJ4 does not detect changes in connected storage devices.  If you want
      to play music from an USB or external drive, you must start BDJ4
      after the device is connected.
    * BDJ4 does not detect changes in connected audio devices.
* MacOS
    * 2025-8-16 Configuration: The font selection button crashes the
      application. This is not a problem on my end, I will post a
      message on the forum when this is fixed.
    * 2025-8 In certain situations, the scrollbar stops working correctly
      when the cursor is moved past the bottom of the scrollbar.
      Try resizing the window.
* Windows
    * The marquee position is not saved when it is iconified (close
      the window instead).
* Linux
    * If a non-default audio sink is configured, and the system default
      audio sink is changed, the audio will switch to the new
      default.  The audio will revert back to the configured audio
      sink when a new song starts playing.
    * The dock icon does not display on the GNOME desktop
      (e.g. Ubuntu 2204 and later).
    * There is an intermittent crash in the podcast updater in the ICU
      library (Debian 12).  An issue with ICU version 72 library.
