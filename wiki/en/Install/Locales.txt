### Installing BDJ4 in Other Locales

<span id="blurb" style="color:#4559bf;">_BDJ4 currently supports the English/GB,
English/US, Nederlands (Dutch) and Русский (Russian) locales_</span>

BDJ4 will use the configured system locale to determine which locale
to use during the installation process and when BDJ4 is running.

The locale may be over-ridden in the BDJ4 configuration.
<br>__References:__
<br>[Configuration&nbsp;/&nbsp;General](en-Configuration-General)

If the system locale is not supported, BDJ4 will use the English/GB
locale.

#### Differences when installing locales

The default locale is English/GB.

When installing in the English/US locale additional dances are
configured.

Non-English locales translate various configuration items.  Dance
names, ratings, genres, dance levels, pre-installed playlist names,
and queue names are all translated. The HTML files used for remote
control and the mobile marquee are also translated.

#### Installing in one locale and displaying another

If the locale is set in the BDJ4 configuration,
([Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;General](en-Configuration-General)),
then the BDJ4 display text will use the configured locale.

For example, BDJ4 can be installed using the Nederlands (Dutch)
locale, then the configured locale changed to use the English/GB
locale. The configuration will use the Nederlands translations for
dance names, ratings, etc.  The BDJ4 display text will be in English.
This configuration works without any issues.

If BDJ4 was installed using the English/GB locale, then the configured
locale changed to Nederlands, then the configuration will use the
English/GB dance names, ratings, etc.  And the BDJ4 display will be in
Nederlands.  This configuration may not be what a user in the
Nederlands locale wants to see.
