### Installing BDJ4 in Other Locales

<span id="blurb" style="color:#4559bf;">_BDJ4 currently supports the
English/GB, English/US, Nederlands (Dutch) and Русский (Russian)
locales.  Deutsch (German) and Español (Spanish) are coming
soon_</span>

As of version 4.17.13, the installer will ask for your preferred
language.  This language will be used to install the localized
configuration files.

The display language will also be set to this selection, but may be
changed in the configuration afterwards (as many languages are machine
translated, their quality is very poor).

__References:__
<br>[Configuration&nbsp;/&nbsp;General](en-Configuration-General)

If the system locale is not supported, BDJ4 will use the English/GB
locale.

#### Differences Between Languages

The default locale is English/GB.

When installing in the English/US locale additional dances are
configured.

Non-English languages translate various configuration items.  Dance
names, ratings, genres, dance levels, pre-installed playlist names,
and queue names are all translated. The HTML files used for remote
control and the mobile marquee are also translated.

#### Installing in one locale and displaying another

If the language is set in the BDJ4 configuration,
([Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;General](en-Configuration-General)),
then the BDJ4 display text will use the configured language.

For example, if BDJ4 is installed with the Nederlands (Dutch) language
selected, then later the configured locale is changed to use the
English/GB locale, then the configuration will use the Nederlands
translations for dance names, ratings, etc.  The BDJ4 display text
will be in English.
