### Overview of BDJ4

A short list of some things that are useful to know when starting out
with BDJ4.

##### Configuration

The configuration is static, not dynamic.  When you change the
configuration, you will need to close and restart the player and
management interfaces.  Configuration changes are not immediately
applied.  Certain configuration options (locale, profile color, accent
color, user interface, et.al.) require exiting BDJ4 and restarting.

##### Database Updates

When a database update is done (rebuild, check for new, re-organize,
etc.), it is safest to exit the player and management interfaces, and
re-open them.  While BDJ4 tries to keep the database changes updated
and consistent, it is still safest to exit and restart to make sure the
management and player interfaces have a consistent view.

##### Definition of a Playlist

A playlist in many music players is a static list of songs, which
can't be changed during playback.

In BDJ4, this is closest to a _Song&nbsp;List_.  But once a
_Song&nbsp;List_ is queued, the BDJ4 player allows songs to be moved,
added, and removed.  This does not modify the original song list.

<br>[Management / Edit Song Lists](en-Management-Edit%20Song%20Lists)
<br>[Subjects / Song Lists](en-Subjects-Song%20Lists)

BDJ4 also has sequences, where dances are played in sequence of your
choosing, and BDJ4 chooses the song to be played.
<br>__References:__
<br>[Management / Edit Sequences](en-Management-Edit%20Sequences)
<br>[Subjects / Sequenced Playlists](en-Subjects-Sequenced%20Playlists)

And there are automatic playlists, where BDJ4 will choose the dance
and the song.
<br>__References:__
<br>[Management / Playlist Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management)
<br>[Subjects / Automatic Playlists](en-Subjects-Automatic%20Playlists)

A BDJ4 _Song&nbsp;List_, _Sequence_ and _Automatic&nbsp;Playlist_ all
have associated playlist settings that can be changed.  Most often, no
changes are needed for song lists.
<br>__References:__
<br>[Management / Playlist Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management)

In all of these cases, once queued for playback, the BDJ4 player
allows songs to be moved, added, and removed.  This does not modify
the original song list, sequence or automatic playlist.

##### Using Genre

Some people use the genre tag to set the dance (Waltz, Rumba, etc.).

In writing BDJ4, I have been careful not to overwrite audio file tags
that people may be using. BDJ4 leaves the genre tag alone so that it
can be used by the user for the purpose they choose (it may be set to
New&nbsp;Age, Jazz, Rock, etc.).  BDJ4 saves the dance in its own tag,
and leaves the genre tag as is.

When updating the BDJ4 database, there is a
_Database&nbsp;Loads&nbsp;Dance&nbsp;from&nbsp;Genre_ option that can
be set to check the genre tag for the dance when the audio file
information is first read and saved into the database.

##### Menus

Menus in BDJ4 are context sensitive, and will change depending on the
selected tab.  Switching to a new tab will update the menu. e.g. in
the Management window, _Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists_ has its own menu.
In the _Music&nbsp;Manager_, the _Music&nbsp;Manager_ sub-tab and the
_Song&nbsp;Editor_ sub-tab have an _Actions_ menu, but the menu
contents are different.

##### Music Queues, Profiles and Alternate Folders

BDJ4 installations have the following structure:

This is the usual configuration that many people have.  A single
installation with one profile and a single music queue.

* Main Installation
    * Profile
        * Music Queue

BDJ4 can be configured with multiple profiles and multiple music queues.
In addition alternate folders can be set up with their own databases
and profiles.

* Main Installation
    * Profile
        * Music Queues (up to 5)
    * Profile
        * Music Queues
* Alternate Folder(s) (separate database)
    * Profile
        * Music Queues
    * Profile
        * Music Queues

The BDJ4 player can display up to five music queues, and each music
queue can be configured in a different fashion.  As examples, a music
queue could be configured for ballroom dances, general playback,
requests, practice, showcase, rounds, or mixers.

<br>[Configuration / Music Queues](en-Configuration-Music%20Queues)
<br>[Subjects / Music Queues](en-Subjects-Music%20Queues)
<br>[Player](en-Player-Player) (Options / Show Extra Queues)

Profiles are used to keep different configurations separate.  As
examples, a profile could be set up for working on music at home, for
use with headphones, for DJ work, for practice sessions or for general
playback.
<br>__Reference:__
<br>[Subjects / Profiles](en-Subjects-Profiles)

An alternate folder is used when you need a separate database. For
example, you might have ballroom music in the main installation, and
an alternate folder for classical music.  The databases and
configurations are separate and don't affect each other.

Alternate folder installation is optimized so that the BDJ4
installation is not duplicated, only the data files are separate.
