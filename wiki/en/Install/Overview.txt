### Overview of BDJ4

A short list of some things that are useful to know when starting out
with BDJ4.

##### Configuration

The configuration is static, not dynamic.  When you change the
configuration, you will need to close and restart the player and
management interfaces.  Configuration changes are not immediately
applied.  Certain configuration options (profile color, accent color,
user interface, et.al.) require restarting BDJ4 entirely.

##### Database Updates

When a database update is done (rebuild, check for new, re-organize,
etc.), it is safest to exit the player and management interfaces, and
re-open them.  While BDJ4 tries to keep the database changes updated
and consistent, it is still safest to exit and restart to make sure the
management and player interfaces have a consistent view.

##### Definition of a Playlist

A playlist in many music players is a static list of songs, which
can't be changed during playback.

In BDJ4, this is closest to a _Song&nbsp;List_.  But once a
_Song&nbsp;List_ is queued, the BDJ4 player allows songs to be moved,
added, and removed.  This does not modify the original song list.

BDJ4 also has sequences, where dances are played in sequence of your
choosing, and BDJ4 chooses the song to be played.

And there are automatic playlists, where BDJ4 will choose the dance
and the song.

<br>[Subjects / Automatic Playlists](en-Subjects-Automatic%20Playlists)

A BDJ4 _Song&nbsp;List_, _Sequence_ and _Automatic&nbsp;Playlist_ all
have associated playlist settings that can be changed.  Most often, no
changes are needed for song lists.

<br>[Management / Playlist Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management)

In all of these cases, once queued for playback, the BDJ4 player
allows songs to be moved, added, and removed.  This does not modify
the original song list, sequence or automatic playlist.

##### Using Genre

Some people use the genre tag to set the dance (Waltz, Rumba, etc.).

In writing BDJ4, I have been careful not to overwrite tags that people
may be using. BDJ4 leaves the genre tag alone so that it can be used
by the user for the purpose they choose (it may be set to New Age,
Jazz, Rock, etc.).  BDJ4 saves the dance in its own tag, and leaves
the genre tag as is.

When updating the BDJ4 database, there is a _Database Loads Dance from
Genre_ option that can be set to check the genre tag for the dance
when the audio file information is first read and saved into the
database.
