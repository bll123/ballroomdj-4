### Converting BallroomDJ 3

It is recommended to upgrade BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 to the latest version
(3.32.23) before installing BDJ4.  Some changes have been made to
BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 to improve compatibility with BDJ4.

Due to some bugs in the conversion process, it is recommended that the
conversion be run (or re-run) with BDJ4 version 4.0.10.1-beta or
later.

If you have a recent version (the BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 database version
must be version&nbsp;7 or later (approximately
BDJ3&nbsp;version&nbsp;2.21 or later)) of BallroomDJ&nbsp;3, and the
BDJ4 installer is able to locate your Ballroom&nbsp;3 installation,
the BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 data files will automatically be converted
during the installation process. The BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 installation is
not changed and may still be used.

The conversion process has been tested with recent versions of
BallroomDJ (version 3.29.x and later) and has not been tested with
older versions of BallroomDJ.  If you have an older version and the
conversion process fails in some fashion, please contact
([Getting%20Help](en-Getting%20Help)) the development team.

If you have an older version of BallroomDJ&nbsp;3, and the BDJ4
installer displays the message __BDJ3 database version is too old__
in the status box, use the following process.  The following process
is set up to preserve your original BallroomDJ installation and make
sure it is not changed.

* Copy your entire BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 folder to another location and/or name.
(e.g. BallroomDJ to BDJ3Temp)
* Rename the BallroomDJ shortcut on the desktop to a new name
(e.g. "BallroomDJ original").
* Download the latest version of BallroomDJ&nbsp;3.
* Run the BallroomDJ 3 installer, but choose the new location
(BDJ3Temp) as the installation location.  The BallroomDJ&nbsp;3
installation process will upgrade your database and data files
to the latest version.
* Delete the BallroomDJ shortcut on the desktop (it is pointing to
the new location).
* Rename the original BallroomDJ shortcut back the way it was
(e.g. "BallroomDJ original" to BallroomDJ).
* Now run the BDJ4 installation process again.  For the BallroomDJ&nbsp;3
location, choose the new location (BDJ3Temp) for BallroomDJ&nbsp;3.
* Remove the new location of BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 (e.g. BDJ3Temp).  Your
original BallroomDJ installation is untouched and can still be used.
