### BDJ4 Maintenance

There are three main pieces of BDJ4 that may need updates.  BDJ4
itself, the player (VLC), and support libraries.

To get the latest BDJ4 fixes, simply download the latest version of
BDJ4 and run the installer.  Select the __Upgrade__ button.

<br>[Installing on Windows](en-Install-Windows)
<br>[Installing on MacOS](en-Install-MacOS)
<br>[Installing on Linux](en-Install-Linux)

VLC is not updated when BDJ4 is upgraded. At the time BDJ4 was written
VLC has been has been fairly stable (3.0.18 and later), and updating
VLC is probably not necessary.  Instructions are included below for
updating VLC in case it becomes necessary to update VLC.

##### Windows

__VLC__

VLC is in the process of creating VLC version 4 (someday).  Do not
upgrade to VLC version 4 on Windows.  At the time this wiki page was
written (2025-3-20), VLC version 4 is broken on Windows.

Go to:
[VideoLAN / VLC / Windows](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html),
and check to make sure that the VLC version (in small print underneath
the download button) is version 3 and not version 4.

On your Windows computer, start VLC.  Select the __Help__ menu, and
select __Check for Updates__.

If a new version of VLC is available, a dialog similar to the
following picture will be displayed.  Check to make sure the update is
not to version 4 and select __Yes__, and then follow the VLC installer
instructions.

__Windows Support Libraries__

These are included with the BDJ4 installation.  Upgrading BDJ4 will
upgrade all of the required software libraries.

##### MacOS

__VLC__

Download the VLC installer from
[VideoLAN / VLC / MacOS X](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html),
and run the VLC installer.

__MacOS Support Libraries__

An internet connection is required.

There was an important bug fix and the GTK library should be version
3.24.37 or later (this was in 2023).

To check the GTK library version,
open a terminal (Finder / Go / Utilities / Terminal) and run:

    sudo port list installed | grep gtk3

If the GTK library version is before version 3.24.37, the support
libraries should be updated via the following instructions.

To get the latest software updates, simply re-run the
macos-pre-install-macports script again.

Download the latest macos-pre-install-macports-v21.sh script from
sourceforge (version 21 as of 2025-3-30).

[BDJ4 files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/)

Open a terminal (Finder / Go / Utilities / Terminal) and run this
script using the following command. This may take a very long time to
finish. You may be required to enter your administrative password more
than once during the installation process.

    cd Downloads
    bash macos-pre-install-macports-v21.sh

##### Linux

On Linux, simply let your software updater run to get the latest
software libraries and the latest VLC.
