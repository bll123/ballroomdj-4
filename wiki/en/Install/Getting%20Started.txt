### Getting Started

#### Configuring BDJ4

###### Set the location of the music folder

The first step is to configure the location of your music folder.
Start BDJ4.  The window that displays is the _Starter_ window. Select
the _Configure_ button.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![Starter](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Install/gs-starter-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Starter**</span> </div>

The configuration window will open and the _General_ section will be
displayed. In the _General_ section, the first item is the _Music
Folder_.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![Configuration / General / Music Folder](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Install/gs-config-folder-C.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Configuration / General / Music Folder**</span> </div>

Use the chooser button on the far right with the folder icon to choose
the location of your music folder.

Leave the configuration window open.

###### Choose how your music is organized

The organization is important so that BDJ4 can determine information
about your songs when the database is built.  Most importantly, the
dance associated with each song, which is not usually stored in the
audio file tags.

In the configuration window, select the _Organization_ section from
the list on the left side of the window.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![Configuration / Organization](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Install/gs-config-org-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Configuration / Organization**</span> </div>

In the _Organization_ section, the default organization is
_Dance/Title_.  This is a common organization method that many people
use where each dance is in a separate folder.

If you have iTunes installed, the organization path will be set to
_Album&nbsp;Artist/Album/Disc&nbsp;-&nbsp;Track0&nbsp;Title_.

Select the organization method you use for your songs in the
_Organization&nbsp;Path_ drop-down.

If your audio files have the dance stored in the genre audio tag, turn
on the _Database&nbsp;Loads&nbsp;Dance&nbsp;from&nbsp;Genre_ switch.

If the organization path you need is not present, contact support
using one of the methods in [Getting&nbsp;Help](en-Getting%20Help).
Many different organization paths are supported, but not all are
listed in the drop-down.

Close the configuration window.

#### Creating the database for the first time

The BDJ4 database contains the information about your songs.  The
information in the database must be populated the first time.

In the _Starter_ window, select the _Manage_ button.  This will open
the management user interface.  Select the _Update Database_ section
in the left side of the management window.

Use the plus and minus buttons to change the selection to
_Rebuild&nbsp;Database_.  Select the _Start_ button.  Depending on how
many songs you have, the database rebuild may take a long time.  Wait
for the database rebuild to finish.  A __Complete__ message will be
displayed when it is done.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![Management / Update Database](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Install/gs-update-db-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Management / Update Database**</span> </div>

Leave the management window open.

#### Check the dance for each song

Select _Music&nbsp;Manager_ in the left side of the management window.
Scroll through the list of songs and check to make sure the dance is
set for each song.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![Management / Music Manager](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Install/gs-mm-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Management / Music Manager**</span> </div>

If the dance is not set, select the song in the listing, then select
the _Song&nbsp;Editor_ tab.  Use the dance drop-down selection and
select the dance for the song.  Select the _Save_ button in the upper
right of the _Song&nbsp;Editor_ tab.  Switch back to the
_Music&nbsp;Manager_ tab and check for other songs that need to have
the dance set.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![Management / Song Editor](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Install/gs-se-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Management / Song Editor**</span> </div>

Leave the management window open.

#### Create an example playlist

Select _Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists_ in the left side of the management
window.  On the right side of the window below the player is a list of
your songs.   Select a song in the right side of the window.  Select
the left arrow button
(![left-arrow](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/LeftButton-A.png))
in the middle of the lower section.  This will
add the song you selected to the song list that is being created.

Select some more songs and add each of them to the song list.

Above the song list is an entry box with the name
_New&nbsp;Song&nbsp;List_ in it.  Click in the box and change the name
of the song list.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![Management / Song List Editor](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Install/gs-sl-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Management / Song List Editor**</span> </div>

Close the management window.  The song list is automatically saved.

#### Play the example playlist

Now select _Player_ in the starter window.  In the player window,
select the _Queue&nbsp;Playlist_ drop-down, and select the example
song list that you just created.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![Player](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Install/gs-player-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Player**</span> </div>

The song list will load into the player and start playing.
