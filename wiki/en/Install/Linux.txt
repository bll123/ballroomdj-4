##### Updating BallroomDJ 4 : Make a Backup

Be sure to exit BallroomDJ 4 before creating a backup or updating the
software.

If you are updating BallroomDJ 4 to a new version, be sure to create a
backup of your BDJ4 installation.  On Linux, make a copy of the
$HOME/BDJ4 folder

##### Install the Requisite Software

If a pre-install script before version 7 was run, you must re-run
this script.

This step only needs to be run once, not for every installation or
update.

Download the linux-pre-install-v9.sh script from sourceforge.

[BDJ4 files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/)

Open a terminal and run this script using the following command:

~~~
bash linux-pre-install-v9.sh
~~~

This script performs the following actions:

* Installs the required software used by BallroomDJ 4.
  (vlc, python3-mutagen, ffmpeg, libcurl, flac, libopusfile).
* Adds the user to the 'audio' group.
* If pulseaudio is installed, sets 'flat-volumes = no' in the $HOME/.config/pulse/daemon.conf file.

will scan your music folder to determine certain settings used in
