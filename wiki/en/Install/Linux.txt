## Installing BallroomDJ 4 on Linux

Supported Platforms as of 2025-8-8: Linux 64-bit.

Only the Debian based distribution has a Linux installers
built for them.  Other distributions will need to build from source.

As of the 4.15.5 release, BDJ4 is more robust across different Linux
distributions.  The code has been fixed to handle versioning issues
for the ICU, avformat and avutil libraries.  The Debian 13 installer
should install on Debian 12 and Debian 11 as well.

However, there are still other libraries that have different versions
across different distributions, and will require building BDJ4 from
source.

If you need help building from source,
[contact](en-Getting%20Help) the development team.

#### Updating BallroomDJ 4 : Make a Backup

Be sure to exit BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 before creating a backup or updating the
software.

If you are updating BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 to a new version, be sure to create a
backup of your BDJ4 installation.  On Linux, make a copy of the
$HOME/BDJ4 folder

#### Install the Requisite Software

If a pre-install script before version 12 was run, you must re-run
this script.

This step only needs to be run once, not for every installation or
update.  An internet connection is required to run this script.

Download the linux-pre-install-v12.sh script from sourceforge.

[BDJ4 files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/)

Open a terminal and run this script using the following command:

    :::bash
    bash linux-pre-install-v12.sh

This script performs the following actions:

* Installs the required software used by BallroomDJ 4.
  (libvlc, ffmpeg, libcurl, flac, libopusfile, etc.).
* Adds the user to the 'audio' group.
* If pulseaudio is installed, sets 'flat-volumes = no' in the $HOME/.config/pulse/daemon.conf file.

Note: Currently, libVLC is installed, but the Linux installation may be
configured to use GStreamer, and libVLC is not necessary.  The GStreamer
interface has not received as much real-world testing as the libVLC
interface.

#### Install BallroomDJ 4

Download the Linux installer from sourceforge.

[BDJ4 files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/)

Choose the appropriate installer.
<br>The Debian 12 installer is built on MX Linux 23, and is suitable
for any Debian based distribution (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian, MX
Linux, etc.).
<br>The OpenSUSE installer is built on OpenSUSE 15.6.

For RedHat and Arch-based distributions, BDJ4 will need to be built
manually.  I cannot create software packages for moving targets.

If you have a Linux distribution where BDJ4 fails to work, or want
supported, please [let me know](Getting%20Help). For the Linux
distributions that do not have a pre-built installer, I can check to
make sure that the build works and that BDJ4 works.

Be sure to exit BDJ4 if it is already started.

Open a terminal and run the installer:

(This is an example and may not be up to date.)

    :::bash
    cd Downloads
    chmod a+rx bdj4-installer-linux-debian12-4.11.0
    ./bdj4-installer-linux-debian12-4.11.0

Choose the folder in which to install BallroomDJ&nbsp;4.  The $HOME/BDJ4
folder will be pre-selected for you.

The __Re-Install__ checkbox is only used if you want to completely
reset all of the BDJ4 data files.  Any changes you have made within
BDJ4 will be lost if a re-install is done.

__Select your preferred language__.  This language will be used to
install the localized configuration files.  The display language will
also be set to this language, but may be changed later.

If you want to convert a BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 installation, select the
BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 folder and select the __Convert&nbsp;BallroomDJ&nbsp;3__
checkbox.

After you have selected the installation folder, select the
__Install__ or __Upgrade__ button and wait for the
__Installation&nbsp;Completed__ message.
