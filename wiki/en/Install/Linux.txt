## Installing BallroomDJ 4 on Linux

#### Updating BallroomDJ 4 : Make a Backup

If you are updating BallroomDJ 4 to a new version, be sure to create a
backup of your BDJ4 installation.  On Linux, make a copy of the
$HOME/BDJ4 folder

#### Install the Requisite Software

This step only needs to be run once, not for every installation or
update.

Download the linux-pre-install.sh script from sourceforge.

[BDJ4 files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/)

Open a terminal and run this script using the following command:

~~~
bash linux-pre-install.sh
~~~

This script performs the following actions:

* Installs the required software used by BallroomDJ 4 (vlc, ffmpeg, libcurl).
* Adds the user to the 'audio' group.
* Sets 'flat-volumes = no' in the $HOME/.config/pulse/daemon.conf file.

#### Internet Connection

An internet connection is required the first time BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 is
installed.  There are requisite packages (Mutagen) that
need to be installed from the internet.

#### Install BallroomDJ 4

Download the Linux installer from sourceforge.

[BDJ4 files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/)

Open a terminal and run the installer:

(This is an example and may not be up to date.)
~~~
$HOME/Downloads/bdj4-installer-linux-4.1.1-beta
~~~

Choose the folder in which to install BallroomDJ 4.  The $HOME/BDJ4
folder will be pre-selected for you.

The __Re-Install__ checkbox is only used if you want to completely
reset all of the BDJ4 data files.  Any changes you have made within
BDJ4 will be lost if a re-install is done. __(If you are updating an
alpha installation, you must do a re-install.)__

If you want to convert a BallroomDJ 3 installation, select the
BallroomDJ 3 folder and select the __Convert BallroomDJ 3__ checkbox.

After you have selected the installation folder, select the __Install__
button and wait for the __Installation Completed__ message.
