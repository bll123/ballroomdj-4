## Installing BallroomDJ 4 on Mac OS

#### Updating BallroomDJ 4 : Make a Backup

If you are updating BallroomDJ 4 to a new version, be sure to create a
backup of your BDJ4 installation.  On Mac OS make a copy of the
$HOME/Applications/BDJ4.app folder and the
$HOME/Library/Application&nbsp;Support/BDJ4 folder.

#### Install the Requisite Software

This step only needs to be run once, not for every installation or
update.

Download the macos-pre-install-v6.sh script from sourceforge.

Open a terminal (Finder / Go / Utilities / Terminal) and run
this script using the following command. This may take a very long
time to finish (especially slow on Ventura as of 2022-11).  You may be
required to enter your administrative password more than once during
the installation process.

    bash macos-pre-install-v6.sh

This script performs the following actions:

* Installs the required software used by BallroomDJ 4.

#### Internet Connection

An internet connection is required the first time BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 is
installed.  There are requisite packages (Mutagen) that
need to be installed from the internet.

#### Install BallroomDJ 4

Download the Mac OS installer from sourceforge.
Be sure to select the correct architecture (Intel or Apple Silicon).

Also download the macos-run-install-v3.sh script from sourceforge.
This script will set up and open the downloaded install package.

Open a terminal (Finder / Go / Utilities / Terminal) and run
this script using the following command:

    bash macos-run-install-v3.sh

Choose the folder in which to install BallroomDJ 4.  The
$HOME/Applications/BDJ4.app folder will be pre-selected for you.

The **Re-Install** checkbox is only used if you want to completely
reset all of the BDJ4 data files.  Any changes you have made within
BDJ4 will be lost if a re-install is done. __(If you are updating an
alpha installation, you must do a re-install.)__


If you want to convert a BallroomDJ 3 installation, select the
BallroomDJ 3 folder ($HOME/Library/Application Support/BallroomDJ) and
select the **Convert BallroomDJ 3** checkbox.

After you have selected the installation folder, select the **Install**
button and wait for the **Installation Completed** message.

icon to the Applications Folder icon.
