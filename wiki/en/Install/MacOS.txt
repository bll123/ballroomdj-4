##### Updating BallroomDJ 4 : Make a Backup

Be sure to exit BallroomDJ 4 before creating a backup or updating the
software.

If you are updating BallroomDJ 4 to a new version, be sure to create a
backup of your BDJ4 installation.  On MacOS make a copy of the
$HOME/Applications/BDJ4.app folder and the
$HOME/Library/Application&nbsp;Support/BDJ4 folder.  If you use
MacOS's time machine, have it do a backup before you proceed.

##### Internet Connection

An internet connection is required the first time BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 is
installed.  There are requisite packages (VLC) that need to be
installed from the internet, and the pre-install script requires and
internet connection.

If the pre-install script has already been run, and VLC is already
installed, no internet connection is required.

##### Install the Requisite Software

If a pre-install script before version 18 was run, you must re-run
this script.

This step only needs to be run once, not for every installation or
update.  An internet connection is required to run this script.

Download the macos-pre-install-macports-v21.sh script from sourceforge.

script using the following command. This may take a very long time to

than once during the installation process.

Also download the macos-run-install-v3.sh script from sourceforge.
This script will set up and open the downloaded install package.

Make sure to exit BDJ4 if it is already started.

this script using the following command:

    cd Downloads
    bash macos-run-install-v3.sh

Choose the folder in which to install BallroomDJ 4.  The
$HOME/Applications/BDJ4.app folder will be pre-selected for you.

The __Re-Install__ checkbox is only used if you want to completely
reset all of the BDJ4 data files.  Any changes you have made within
BDJ4 will be lost if a re-install is done.

If you want to convert a BallroomDJ 3 installation, select the
BallroomDJ 3 folder ($HOME/Library/Application Support/BallroomDJ) and
select the __Convert BallroomDJ 3__ checkbox.

After you have selected the installation folder, select the __Install__
button and wait for the __Installation Completed__ message.
