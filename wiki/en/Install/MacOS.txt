#### Updating BallroomDJ 4 : Make a Backup

Be sure to exit BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 before creating a backup or updating the
software.

If you are updating BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 to a new version, be sure to create a
backup of your BDJ4 installation.  On MacOS make a copy of the
$HOME/Applications/BDJ4.app folder and the
$HOME/Library/Application&nbsp;Support/BDJ4 folder.  If you use
MacOS's time machine, have it do a backup before you proceed.

#### Internet Connection

An internet connection is required the first time BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 is
installed.  There are requisite packages (VLC) that need to be
installed from the internet, and the pre-install script requires an
internet connection.

If the pre-install script has already been run, and VLC is already
installed, no internet connection is required.

#### Install the Requisite Software

If a pre-install script before version 18 was run, you must re-run
this script.

This step only needs to be run once, not for every installation or
update.  An internet connection is required to run this script.

Download the macos-pre-install-macports-v24.sh script.

If you wish to use the __pkgsrc__ package management system,
<br>
Download the macos-pre-install-pkgsrc-v24.sh script.

Open a terminal (Finder / Go / Utilities / Terminal) and run this
script using the following command. This may take a very long time to
finish. You may be required to enter your administrative password more
than once during the installation process.

    cd Downloads
    bash macos-pre-install-macports-v24.sh

If you are using the _pkgsrc_ package management system, use:

    cd Downloads
    bash macos-pre-install-pkgsrc-v24.sh

This script performs the following actions:

* Installs the required software used by BallroomDJ 4.

Note that this process can be very slow for new releases of MacOS.

#### Install BallroomDJ 4

Download the MacOS installer from sourceforge.

Be sure to select the correct architecture (Intel or Apple Silicon).

Be sure to select the correct package manager (macports or pkgsrc).

Also download the macos-run-install-v5.sh script from sourceforge.
This script will set up and open the downloaded install package.

Make sure to exit BDJ4 if it is already started.

Open a terminal (Finder / Go / Utilities / Terminal) and run
this script using the following command:

    cd Downloads
    bash macos-run-install-v5.sh

Choose the folder in which to install BallroomDJ&nbsp;4.  The
$HOME/Applications/BDJ4.app folder will be pre-selected for you.

The __Re-Install__ checkbox is only used if you want to completely
reset all of the BDJ4 data files.  Any changes you have made within
BDJ4 will be lost if a re-install is done.

If you want to convert a BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 installation, select the
BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 folder ($HOME/Library/Application Support/BallroomDJ) and
select the __Convert&nbsp;BallroomDJ&nbsp;3__ checkbox.

After you have selected the installation folder, select the
__Install__ or __Upgrade__ button and wait for the
__Installation&nbsp;Completed__ message.

If VLC is not already installed on your computer, the installation
process will download and start the VLC installation.  Drag the VLC.app
icon to the Applications Folder icon.

#### Notes on MacOS Package Managers

The following package managers are available for MacOS:
MacPorts, pkgsrc and Homebrew.

MacPorts is very reliable, though sometimes slow, as not all packages
have pre-built binaries (especially on newer releases).  MacPorts
supports older versions of MacOS.  MacPorts packages may not be fully
up to date.

pkgsrc on MacOS is currently support by a commecial company that has
pre-built binary packages available.  If this company goes away, the
packages would have to be built from scratch, which takes a very long
time, and has not been tested.

Homebrew is very popular, as it installs pre-built binaries. Homebrew
does not use elevated permissions (except during initial setup), and
this setup creates a security hole. Homebrew does not support older
MacOS versions.

On Intel MacOS, Homebrew refuses to make certain libraries available
for easy use.  This would make building BDJ4 extremely difficult, and
also make a pre-built BDJ4 virtually impossible to run, as users may
have different versions of these required libraries.

On Apple silicon MacOS, BDJ4 is not working properly with Homebrew,
and I don't know that I want to spend the time debugging their builds
to figure out what has gone wrong.  It could be possible to support
BDJ4 + Homebrew on Apple silicon MacOS, but the effort doesn't seem to
be worth the trouble.
