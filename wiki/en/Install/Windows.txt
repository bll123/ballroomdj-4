## Installing BallroomDJ 4 on Windows

Supported Platforms as of 2023-3-15: Windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;(64-bit),
Windows&nbsp;11&nbsp;(64-bit).

##### Updating BallroomDJ 4 : Make a Backup

Be sure to exit BallroomDJ 4 before creating a backup or updating the
software.

If you are updating BallroomDJ 4 to a new version, be sure to create a
backup of your BDJ4 installation.  On Windows, simply make a copy of
the entire BDJ4 folder.

##### Windows 11 bug / Installation Issues

Windows 11 has a possible bug where the BallroomDJ 4 installer will
just exit or return an error 0xC0000142.

This is possibly caused by corruption of the user profile or
corruption of the user permissions.

One work around is to right click on the BallroomDJ 4 installer and
run the installer as administrator. BallroomDJ 4 does not require
administrative permissions to install, this is a work around for the
Windows 11 issue.

Another method that may work is to delete the user account and
re-create it. This is an extreme solution, and I do not know if the
user account will stay uncorrupted.

As far as I know, this bug does not occur on Windows 10.

##### Internet Connection

An internet connection is required the first time BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 is
installed.  There are requisite packages (VLC, Python, Mutagen) that
need to be installed from the internet.

##### Install BallroomDJ 4

Download the Windows installer from sourceforge.

[BDJ4 files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/)

Make sure to exit BDJ4 if it is already started.

Start the installer by double clicking the downloaded file in your
Downloads folder. (This image shows an out of date installer).

If windows displays the __Windows Protected your PC__ message, select

Choose the folder in which to install BallroomDJ 4.  The
%USERPROFILE%\BDJ4 folder will be pre-selected for you.

The __Re-Install__ checkbox is only used if you want to completely
reset all of the BDJ4 data files.  Any changes you have made within
BDJ4 will be lost if a re-install is done.

Choose the location of your music folder.  The installation process
will scan your music folder to determine certain settings used in
BDJ4.

If you want to convert a BallroomDJ 3 installation, select the
BallroomDJ 3 folder and select the __Convert BallroomDJ 3__ checkbox.

After you have selected the installation folder, select the
__Install__ button and wait for the __Installation Completed__
message.

language and select __OK__. Select the __Next__ button twice and you

associations off.
