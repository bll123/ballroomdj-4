## Installing BallroomDJ 4 on Windows

Supported Platforms as of 2023-3-15: Windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;(64-bit),
Windows&nbsp;11&nbsp;(64-bit).

#### Windows and Anti-Virus Programs

__\*\* BallroomDJ 4 does not have any malware or viruses in it. \*\*__

Microsoft's Windows Defender's online anti-virus check will mark
novel, small programs as a virus.  In BDJ4, this includes the
installation extractor, the BDJ4 launcher and the BDJ4 startup helper.
Other anti-virus programs will probably have similar issues.

I can submit false positives to Microsoft, and they will fix their
database.   But many other anti-virus companies do not have a method
where false positives can be submitted.  And there are far too many
anti-virus products for me to do so.

If you have a false positive for BDJ4, and use Windows Defender,
[let&nbsp;me&nbsp;know](en-Getting%20Help), and I can get the false
positive cleared.  Please include a screenshot from Virus &amp; Threat
Protection / Protection History and open the message about the
quarantined threat (I need the information from the "Detected:" line).

For other anti-virus products you will need to submit the
false positive yourself, or mark BDJ4 as safe on your computer.

To update the anti-virus definitions for Windows Defender, do:

1. Open command prompt (cmd.exe) as administrator and change directory to
c:\Program&nbsp;Files\Windows&nbsp;Defender and enter the following
commands.
* MpCmdRun.exe&nbsp;-removedefinitions&nbsp;-dynamicsignatures
* MpCmdRun.exe&nbsp;-SignatureUpdate

#### Updating BallroomDJ 4 : Make a Backup

Be sure to exit BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 before creating a backup or updating the
software.

If you are updating BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 to a new version, be sure to create a
backup of your BDJ4 installation.  On Windows, simply make a copy of
the entire BDJ4 folder.

#### Internet Connection

If the __Please&nbsp;install&nbsp;VLC__ checkbox is selected, an
internet connection is required the first time BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 is
installed. The VLC package will be installed via the internet.

If VLC is already installed, no internet connection is required.

#### Install BallroomDJ 4

Download the Windows installer from sourceforge.

[BDJ4 files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/)

Make sure to exit BDJ4 if it is already started.

Start the installer by double clicking the downloaded file in your
Downloads folder. (This image shows an out of date installer).

If windows displays the __Windows Protected your PC__ message, select
__More Info__, then __Run Anyway__.  BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 has no malware
present in it.

Choose the folder in which to install BallroomDJ&nbsp;4.  The
%USERPROFILE%\BDJ4 folder will be pre-selected for you.

The __Re-Install__ checkbox is only used if you want to completely
reset all of the BDJ4 data files.  Any changes you have made within
BDJ4 will be lost if a re-install is done.

If you want to convert a BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 installation, select the
BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 folder and select the __Convert&nbsp;BallroomDJ&nbsp;3__
checkbox.

After you have selected the installation folder, select the
__Install__ or __Upgrade__ button and wait for the
__Installation&nbsp;Completed__ message.

#### VLC Installation

If you are doing a new install of BDJ4 and the
__Please&nbsp;install&nbsp;VLC__ checkbox is not selected, you may
skip this section.

If the VLC application is not installed, the VLC installer will be
downloaded and started for you.

If the VLC installation starts, and there is no window displayed,
check for a blinking icon in your Windows taskbar, and select it.

In the Windows __User&nbsp;Account&nbsp;Control__ window, select
__Yes__.  Select the VLC installation language and select __OK__.
Select the __Next__ button twice and you should be in the VLC __Choose
Components__ selection.

Scroll down until you see __File Type Associations__.

If you do not use VLC as your current media player, select the
__File&nbsp;&nbsp;Type&nbsp;Associations__ checkbox twice.  The first
click will turn on all file type associations, the second click will
turn off all file type associations.

Now select __Next__, then select __Install__. After the VLC
installation is complete, turn off the
__Run&nbsp;VLC&nbsp;media&nbsp;player__ checkbox, and select
__Finish__.
