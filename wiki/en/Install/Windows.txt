## Installing BallroomDJ 4 on Windows

Supported Platforms as of 2023-3-15: Windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;(64-bit),
Windows&nbsp;11&nbsp;(64-bit).

##### Windows and Anti-Virus Programs

__*\* BallroomDJ 4 does not have any viruses in it. \*\*__

MicroSoft's Windows Defender's online anti-virus check will mark
novel, small programs as a virus.  In BDJ4, this includes the
installation extractor and the BDJ4 launcher.  Other anti-virus
programs will probably have similar issues.

I can submit false positives to MicroSoft, and they will fix their
database.   But many other anti-virus companies do not have a method
where false positives can be submitted.  And there are far too many
anti-virus products for me to do so.

If you have a false positive for BDJ4, and use Windows Defender,
[let&nbsp;me&nbsp;know](en-Getting%20Help), and I can get the false
positive cleared.

For other anti-virus products you will need to submit the
false positive yourself, or mark BDJ4 as safe on your computer.

To update the anti-virus definitions for Windows Defender, do:

1. Open command prompt (cmd.exe) as administrator and change directory to
c:\Program&nbsp;Files\Windows&nbsp;Defender
* Type: MpCmdRun.exe&nbsp;-removedefinitions&nbsp;-dynamicsignatures
<br>
and press the enter key.
* Type: MpCmdRun.exe&nbsp;-SignatureUpdate
<br>
and press the enter key.

##### Updating BallroomDJ 4 : Make a Backup

Be sure to exit BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 before creating a backup or updating the
software.

If you are updating BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 to a new version, be sure to create a
backup of your BDJ4 installation.  On Windows, simply make a copy of
the entire BDJ4 folder.

##### Internet Connection

An internet connection is required the first time BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 is
installed.  There are requisite packages (VLC) that
need to be installed from the internet.

If VLC is already installed, no internet connection is required.

##### VLC Version

At this time, VLC version 4 (which has not been released as of
2025-4-9), is broken. BDJ4 will not work correctly with VLC
version&nbsp;4. BDJ4 will install VLC version 3.0.21.

If VLC version 4 is already installed, the VLC installation will not
be overwritten.  [Contact](en-Getting%20Help) the BDJ4 developers if
you have this situation.  You will either need to install both VLC
version&nbsp;4 and version&nbsp;3 or only use VLC version&nbsp;3.

##### Install BallroomDJ 4

Download the Windows installer from sourceforge.

[BDJ4 files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballroomdj4/files/)

Make sure to exit BDJ4 if it is already started.

Start the installer by double clicking the downloaded file in your
Downloads folder. (This image shows an out of date installer).

If windows displays the __Windows Protected your PC__ message, select
__More Info__, then __Run Anyway__.  BallroomDJ&nbsp;4 has no malware
present in it.

Choose the folder in which to install BallroomDJ&nbsp;4.  The
%USERPROFILE%\BDJ4 folder will be pre-selected for you.

The __Re-Install__ checkbox is only used if you want to completely
reset all of the BDJ4 data files.  Any changes you have made within
BDJ4 will be lost if a re-install is done.

If you want to convert a BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 installation, select the
BallroomDJ&nbsp;3 folder and select the __Convert&nbsp;BallroomDJ&nbsp;3__
checkbox.

After you have selected the installation folder, select the
__Install__ or __Upgrade__ button and wait for the
__Installation&nbsp;Completed__ message.

If the VLC application is not installed, the VLC installer will be
downloaded and started for you.  In the Windows __User Account
Control__ window, select __Yes__.  Select the VLC installation
language and select __OK__. Select the __Next__ button twice and you
should be in the VLC __Choose Components__ selection.

Scroll down until you see __File Type Associations__.

If you do not use VLC as your current media player, select the __File
Type Associations__ checkbox twice.  The first click will turn on all
file type associations, the second click will turn all file type
associations off.

Now select __Next__, then select __Install__. After the VLC
installation is complete, turn off the __Run VLC media player__
checkbox, and select __Finish__.
