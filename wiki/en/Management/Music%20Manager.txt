with the song editor to manage songs._</span>

[TOC]

### Manage : Music Manager

The music manager displays a listing of songs.  Like the other song
selection listings, the songs can be filtered to display the song
selections you want to work with.

Once the music manager listing has been filtered, the song editor can
traverse through the songs listed in the music manager.

There are some important differences from song selection.

##### Filter Dialog

The filter dialog has an additional drop-down where a playlist may be
selected.  When a playlist is selected, the other filters are
disabled, and the songs from the playlist are listed.

The song editor can then be used to edit the songs from the selected
playlist.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Music Manager / Filters__</span> </div>

Note that the _Dance&nbsp;Rating_ filter will select any songs that
have the selected rating or better.

##### Song Selection with the Song Editor or Audio Identification

When switching to the Music Manager from
[Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists](en-Management-Edit%20Song%20Lists), or the
edit button is used, the music manager will automatically set the
filter to use the loaded playlist.  The filter dialog will show the
currently selected playlist.

This makes it easy to edit the songs in the song list.  Simply select
the edit button in
[Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists](en-Management-Edit%20Song%20Lists) to
switch to the song editor.  The __Next__ and __Previous__ buttons
will traverse the songs in the song list, as the music manager's
filter has been set to use the loaded playlist.

When switching to the Music Manager from the song selection tab, or
the edit button is used in the song selection tab, the music manager
will automatically use the filters set in song selection. The song
editor can then be used to traverse the songs that have been selected.

If you have a listing loaded in the music manager, multiple songs may
be selected (using control-click or shift-click).  When multiple songs
are selected in the music manager, the song editor will traverse the
selected songs, not the entire listing.

The __First__, __Next__, and __Previous__ previous buttons in
[Audio&nbsp;Identification](en-Management-Audio%20Identification)
will also act upon the Music&nbsp;Manager's current selection.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Music Manager / Actions Menu__</span> </div>

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Mark as Same Song__ will mark the
selected songs as the same song.
<br>
(See [Subjects / Same&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Marks](en-Subjects-Same%20Song%20Marks))

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Clear Same Song Mark__ will clear the
same song markers from the selected songs.
<br>
(See [Subjects / Same&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Marks](en-Subjects-Same%20Song%20Marks))

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Remove&nbsp;Song__ will remove a song from the
database.
<br>
(See [Subjects / Removing&nbsp;Songs](en-Subjects-Removing%20Songs))

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Undo&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Removal__ will undo any
pending song removals.
<br>
(See [Subjects / Removing&nbsp;Songs](en-Subjects-Removing%20Songs))

##### Same Song Marks

Same song marks can be used to prevent the automatic or sequence song
selection from choosing songs that are the same but played by
different artists.

For example, if you have a copy of __Sway__ by __Michael Bubl√©__
and also a copy of __Sway__ by __Pussy Cat Dolls__, these can be
marked as the same song.
