### Management : Edit Sequences

<span style="color:#4559bf;">_A sequence is a playlist with an exact
sequence of dances and the songs are selected by BDJ4._</span>

In all cases, the sequence is automatically saved.

###### The Sequence Editor

The left side of the window has the list of dances to choose from, and
the right side of the window contains the sequence.

Use the left and right arrows
(![left](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/LeftButton-A.png),
![right](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/RightButton-A.png))
to remove and add dances to the sequence.

Use the up and down arrows
(![move-up](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/UpButton-A.png),
![move-down](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DownButton-A.png))
to change the order of the sequence.

![seq](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/seq-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Management / Edit Sequences**</span> </div>

###### Naming the Sequence

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![seq-name-entry-A](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/seq-name-entry-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Management / Edit Sequences / Sequence Name**</span> </div>

At the top of the song list, there is an entry box with the song list
name.  This defaults to _New&nbsp;Sequence_.  Click in the entry
box and change the name of the song list.

If you forget to change the name, the song list will be saved as
_New&nbsp;Sequence_.

###### Edit Menu

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![seq-edit-menu](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/seq-edit-menu-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Management / Edit Sequences / Edit Menu**</span> </div>

An existing sequence can be loaded by selecting
_Edit_&nbsp;/&nbsp;_Load_ from the menu.  A dialog will open
allowing selection of an existing sequence.

_Edit_&nbsp;/&nbsp;_Start&nbsp;New&nbsp;Sequence_ will clean out
any loaded sequence and reset the name to _New&nbsp;Sequence_.

_Edit_&nbsp;/&nbsp;_Create&nbsp;Copy_ will create a copy of the
currently loaded sequence and create a new name with _Copy&nbsp;of_
prefixed to the old name.

_Edit_&nbsp;/&nbsp;_Delete_ will delete the currently loaded
sequence from your storage device and start a new sequence.

###### Song Selection

To filter which songs are selected by BDJ4 when the sequence is
played, change the settings in
[Playlist%20Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management).
