### Manage : Edit Sequences

In all cases, the sequence is automatically saved.

##### The Sequence Editor

The left side of the window has the list of dances to choose from, and
the right side of the window contains the sequence.

Use the right arrow
(![right](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/RightButton-B.png)),
to add dances to the sequence.

Use the up and down arrows
(![move-up](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/UpButton-B.png),
![move-down](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DownButton-B.png))
to change the order of the sequence.

Use the remove button
(![remove](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DeleteButton-E.png))
to remove a dance from the sequence.

##### Naming the Sequence

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![seq-name-entry-A](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/seq-name-entry-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Edit Sequences / Sequence Name__</span> </div>

At the top of the sequence there is an entry box with the sequence
name.  This defaults to _New&nbsp;Sequence_.  Click in the entry
box and change the name of the song list.

On all platforms, the slash and backslash characters are not allowed
in sequence names.

On Windows, the following characters are not allowed in sequence names:
**&nbsp;*&nbsp;'&nbsp;"&nbsp;:&nbsp;|&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;^&nbsp;**

If you forget to change the name, the sequence will be saved as
_New&nbsp;Sequence_. To rename it afterwards, simply select
__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Load__ from the menu.  Select
_New&nbsp;Sequence_, then enter the new name of the sequence.

##### Edit Menu

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![seq-edit-menu](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/seq-edit-menu-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Edit Sequences / Edit Menu__</span> </div>

An existing sequence can be loaded by selecting
__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Load__ from the menu.  A dialog will open
allowing selection of an existing sequence.

__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Start&nbsp;New&nbsp;Sequence__ will clean
out any loaded sequence and reset the name to _New&nbsp;Sequence_.

__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Create&nbsp;Copy__ will create a copy of
the currently loaded sequence and create a new name with
_Copy&nbsp;of_ prefixed to the old name.

__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Delete__ will delete the currently loaded
sequence from your storage device and start a new sequence.

##### Song Selection

To filter which songs are selected by BDJ4 when the sequence is
played, change the settings in
[Playlist%20Management](en-Management-Playlist%20Management).
