### Manage : Edit Song Lists

In all cases, the song list is automatically saved.

##### Side-by-Side View

This is the default layout.  The left side of the window has the song
list, and the right side has the song selection.  Due to the side by
side layout, less information can be displayed about each song.  The
columns displayed can be changed in
[Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings) using the
_Side&#8209;by&#8209;Side&nbsp;Song&nbsp;List_ and
_Side&#8209;by&#8209;Side&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Selection_ selections.

The left arrow button (![Left
Arrow](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/LeftButton-B.png))
in-between the two listings will add the current song selection to the
song list.  Multiple songs may be selected in the song selection list
by holding down the _Control_ key when clicking on each song.

##### Song List Editor

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![sl-options-menu](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/sl-options-menu-C.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Edit Song Lists / Options Menu__</span> </div>

An alternate layout is available by turning off the
_Side&#8209;by&#8209;Side&nbsp;View_ in the __Options__ menu.  The
song list and the song selection are displayed in separate tabs.  This
layout allows more information about each song to be displayed. The
columns displayed can be changed in
[Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings) using the
_Song&nbsp;List_ and _Song%20Selection_ selections.

In the song selection tab, select the songs to add to the song list.
Multiple songs may be selected in the song selection list by holding
down the _Control_ key when clicking on each song.  Use the _Select_
button at the top of the listing to add the songs to the song list.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Edit Song Lists (Standard)__</span> </div>

##### Naming the Song List

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![sl-name-entry](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/sl-name-entry-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Edit Song Lists / Song List Name__</span> </div>

At the top of the song list, there is an entry box with the song list
name.  This defaults to _New&nbsp;Song&nbsp;List_.  Click in the entry
box and change the name of the song list.

On all platforms, the slash and backslash characters are not allowed
in song list names.

On Windows, the following characters are not allowed in song list names:
__&nbsp;*&nbsp;'&nbsp;"&nbsp;:&nbsp;|&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;^&nbsp;__

If you forget to change the name, the song list will be saved as
_New&nbsp;Song&nbsp;List_.  To rename it afterwards, simply select
__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Load__ from the menu.  Select
_New&nbsp;Song&nbsp;List_, then enter the new name of the song list.

##### Song Selection Indicators

The song selection listing will display a mark before each song that
is already in the song list.  (See the
_Side&#8209;by&#8209;Side&nbsp;View_ image above).

##### Filtering the Song Selection

The song selection list can be filtered so that you can find the dance
and type of song easily.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![sl-filter-button](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/sl-filter-button-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Edit Song Lists / Filter Button__</span> </div>

Use the filter button (![Filter
Songs](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/FilterSongsButton-A.png))
to display the filter dialog.  In this dialog, select the filters you
want activated and select __Apply__.  The song selection listing will
be updated.  The filter dialog will stay open so it can be used again.
The filters displayed can be adjusted in
[Configuration&nbsp;/&nbsp;Dialogs](en-Configuration-Dialogs).

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![sl-filter-dialog](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/sl-filter-dialog-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Edit Song Lists / Filter Dialog__</span> </div>

Note that the _Dance&nbsp;Rating_ filter will select any songs that
have the selected rating __or better__.

Above the song selection listing, the dance drop-down may be used to
quickly change which dance is displayed in the song selection listing.
Any other filters that have been selected in the filter dialog remain
active.  Use the __Reset__ button in the filter dialog to clear all song
selection filters.

##### Modifying the Song List

At the top of the song list, the move-to-top button
(![move-to-top](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/MoveToTopButton-B.png))
will move the currently selected song to the top.  The move up and
move down buttons
(![move-up](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/UpButton-B.png),
![move-down](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/DownButton-B.png))
will move the song up and down.  The remove button
(![remove](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/RemoveSongButton-B.png))
will remove the selection from the song list.

##### Reviewing a Song

While in the song list or the song selection, select the play button
(![Play](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/PlayButton-A.png))
above the listing to play the currently selected song.

Note that the play/pause button in the player section will not play
the selected song, it is only used for song currently in the player.

##### Editing a Song

While in the song list or the song selection, select the edit button
(![edit](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/EditButton-B.png))
to edit a song.  This will open the
[Song&nbsp;Editor](en-Management-Song%20Editor) with the currently
selected song.  Be sure to use the __Save__ button while in the song
editor.

The _Statistics_ tab displays information about the song list.  The
number of songs, the total time, and a breakdown of how many songs for
each dance is displayed.
