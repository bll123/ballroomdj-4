### Manage : Update Database

Update Database has several possible actions. Select the __Action__ you
want to use, then select the _Start_ button to start processing.  The
__Stop__ button will activate, and can be used to stop processing at any
time.  When processing is finished, a _Complete_ message will be
displayed in the processing status box.

__Check for New__: Used to check for new audio files and add them to
the database.  Any existing entries in the database are not changed.

__Reorganize__: Re-organizes the audio files according to the
organization configuration.
<br>See: [Subjects / Organizing Music](en-Subjects-Organizing%20Music).

__Update from Audio File Tags__: The BDJ4 database is updated from the
information read from the audio file tags.  This action is used when
a tagging program has been used to update the audio file tags.

__Write Tags to Audio Files__: Uses the information in the BDJ4
database to update the audio file tags in the audio files. The
__Write&nbsp;Audio&nbsp;File&nbsp;Tags__ configuration setting must be
set.

__Update from iTunes__: The BDJ4 database is updated from the
information read from the iTunes database. If iTunes is not
configured, the start button will be disabled.
<br>See: [Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;iTunes](en-Configuration-iTunes)

__Rebuild Database__: Rebuilds the database completely.  Any
information stored in the database that is not stored in the audio
file tags will be lost.

The __Music Folder__ will normally be set to the configured music
folder.  If you want to add an additional music folder to the database
that is not within the configured music folder, use the directory
chooser button with the folder icon to select the additional music
folder.  Set the __Action__ to _Check&nbsp;for&nbsp;New_.  Do not use
_Rebuild&nbsp;Database_ to add an additional music folder.

#### Notes on Audio File Tags

Updating the database will import the audio file tags if possible.
Some commercial entities add incorrect audio file tags in some cases.

Grouping: If the grouping tag is all digits, it will not be added to
the BDJ4 database.

Title Sort: If the title sort tag is one of: Orchestra, Pop,
Soundtrack, World Music, Classic Music, Easy Listening, Latin Pop,
Musette &amp; Chanson/Folk/Gipsy, Nu Jazz, Electro Swing, Rhythm &
Blues/Rockabilly, Soul/Gospel, or Swing, the title sort tag will be
ignored.  More genres may be added to this list at a future date.
