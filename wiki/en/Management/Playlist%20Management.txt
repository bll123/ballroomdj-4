### Manage : Playlist Management

In all cases, the playlist is automatically saved.

Automatic playlists are created using playlist management.

##### Playlist Controls

Playlist controls are in the __Settings__ tab.

The __Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time__, __Stop&nbsp;At__ time,
__Stop&nbsp;After__ count, __Gap__ and __Play&nbsp;Announcements__
playlist controls are available for song lists, seuqences and
automatic playlists.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Playlist Management / Playlist Controls__</span> </div>

__Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time__ sets the maximum duration of a song for
this playlist.  The maximum play time set here will override the
music queue __Maximum&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Time__ setting.

<br>[Music&nbsp;Queues](en-Configuration-Music%20Queues)

__Stop&nbsp;At__ sets the time when the playlist will stop. The stop at
time set here will override the player per-queue __Stop&nbsp;At__
setting.
<br>__References:__
<br>[Music&nbsp;Queues](en-Configuration-Music%20Queues)

__Stop&nbsp;After__ configures how many songs will play from this
playlist.

If __Play&nbsp;Announcements__ is enabled, announcements will be played
for each song for this playlist.

##### Song Selection Filters

Song selection filters are in the __Settings__ tab.

The song selection filters are only displayed for automatic and sequenced
playlists.  The filters limit which songs can be played.

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Playlist Management / Song Selection__</span> </div>

__Dance&nbsp;Rating__ sets the minimum rating for a song to be chosen.
Any song with a rating equal to __or better__ than the dance rating set
here may be played.
<br>__References:__
<br>[Edit&nbsp;Ratings](en-Configuration-Edit%20Ratings)

__Low&nbsp;Dance&nbsp;Level__ and __High&nbsp;Dance&nbsp;Level__ are
optional.  Leave these set to _Easy_ and _Advanced_ if levels are not
in use.

__Low&nbsp;Dance&nbsp;Level__ sets the lowest dance level.  Any song
with a dance level equal to or higher than the dance level set here
may be played.
<br>__References:__
<br>[Edit&nbsp;Levels](en-Configuration-Edit%20Levels)

__High&nbsp;Dance&nbsp;Level__ sets the highest dance level.  Any song
with a dance level equal to or lower than the dance level set here may
be played.
<br>__References:__
<br>[Edit&nbsp;Levels](en-Configuration-Edit%20Levels)

If a song has a keyword set, and the keyword is in the
__Allowed&nbsp;Keywords__ list, then the song may be played.  If a song
has a keyword set and the keyword is not in the
__Allowed&nbsp;Keywords__ list, the song will not be played.

__Tag__ and __Tag Weight__: Enter a list of tags to match.  If one of
the tags matches the song's keyword, or any of the song tags, then the
tag weight is applied to the song selection process.  This setting is
used to make songs with a matching keyword or tag more likely to
appear during the song selection process.

In addition, the playable status is always used for song selection. If
the song's status does not have the __Play?__ flag set, the song will
not be played.

##### Per Dance Playlist Controls

The per dance playlist controls are in the __Dances__ tab.

Be careful when using the scroll wheel in this window, as the spinbox
widgets will change value when the scroll wheel is used.

The per-dance selection changes depending on the type of playlist.

Song lists can only have the maximum play time configured per dance.
All dances will be listed.

The maximum play time, low MPM/BPM and high MPM/BPM can be configured per
dance for automatic and sequenced playlists.

For automatic playlists, the dances that may be played are selected
here, and the relative count for each dance is also set here.

For automatic playlists, the __Hide&nbsp;Unselected__ checkbox may be
used to limit which dances are displayed.

If the maximum play time is set for a particular dance, it will
override the player per-queue maximum play time setting and the
playlist maximum play time setting.

To change a setting, select the dance, then click on the field to be
changed.

##### Naming the Playlist

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![plmgmt-name-entry](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/plmgmt-name-entry-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Playlist Management / Playlist Name__</span> </div>

At the top of the window, there is an entry box with the playlist
name.  This defaults to _New&nbsp;Playlist_.  Click in the entry
box and change the name of the playlist.  If there is a song list or
sequence associated with the playlist, it will also be renamed.

On all platforms, the slash and backslash characters are not allowed
in playlist names.

On Windows, the following characters are not allowed in playlist names:
__&nbsp;*&nbsp;'&nbsp;"&nbsp;:&nbsp;|&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;^&nbsp;__

If you forget to change the name, the automatic playlist will be saved
as _New&nbsp;Playlist_. To rename it afterwards, simply select
__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Load__ from the menu.  Select _New&nbsp;Playlist_,
then enter the new name of the automatic playlist.

##### Edit Menu

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">__Manage / Playlist Management / Edit Menu__</span> </div>

__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Load__ will open a dialog to select an existing
playlist.  Select a playlist and select the __Select__ button to load
it. Any current playlist will be saved first.

__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;New&nbsp;Automatic&nbsp;Playlist__ will clean out
any loaded playlist and reset the name to _New&nbsp;Playlist_.  The
playlist type will be set to _Automatic_.

__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Create&nbsp;Copy__ will create a copy of the
currently loaded playlist and create a new name with _Copy&nbsp;of_
prefixed to the old name. If there is a song list or sequence
associated with the playlist, it will also be copied.

__Edit&nbsp;/&nbsp;Delete__ will delete the currently loaded playlist
from your storage device and start a new automatic playlist.
