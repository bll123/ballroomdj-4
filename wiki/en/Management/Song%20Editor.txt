### Management : Song Editor

<span style="color:#4559bf;">The song editor is used to update
song information and to adjust playback settings for the song._</span>

##### Display Columns

The fields displayed in the song editor can be set in
[Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings). Up to
three display columns may be configured. A full list of fields is at
the bottom of this wiki page.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![se](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/se-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Manage / Song Editor**</span> </div>

##### Traversing the Song Listing

The song editor works in conjunction with the
[Music&nbsp;Manager](en-Management-Music%20Manager).  The __First__,
__Next__ and __Previous__ buttons traverse the songs selected in the
[Music&nbsp;Manager](en-Management-Music%20Manager). See the
[Music&nbsp;Manager](en-Management-Music%20Manager) wiki page for
details.

When a song is selected in
[Edit&nbsp;Song&nbsp;Lists](en-Management-Edit%20Song%20Lists), or the
edit button is used, the __Next__ and __Previous__ buttons will
traverse the songs in the song list.

When a song is selected in the song selection tab, or the edit button
is used in the song selection tab, the song editor
will traverse the songs in the song selection.

If you have a listing loaded in the music manager, multiple songs may
be selected (using control-click or shift-click).  When multiple songs
are selected in the music manager, the song editor will traverse the
selected songs, and not the entire listing.

##### File Display

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![se-file-disp](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/se-file-disp-A.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Manage / Song Editor / File Display**</span> </div>

If the audio file has a MusicBrainz recording ID tag set, the
MusicBrainz logo will be displayed.

If the audio file has been modified from the original (via
speed adjustments, song start/end adjustments or trimmed
silence), a __*__ will be displayed.

The filename is displayed.  The music folder set in
[Configure&nbsp;/&nbsp;General](en-Configuration-General) is not
displayed as part of the filename. The copy button
(![copy](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/CopyButton-A.png))
may be used to copy the full filename to the clipboard.

##### Change Bars

When a field in the song editor is modified, a green bar is displayed
before the field's label.

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">

<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Manage / Song Editor / Change Bars**</span> </div>

##### Saving the Changes

The changes made in the song editor are not automatically saved.  Use
the __Save__ button in the upper right to save the changes.

If you want to reset the changes you have made, simply use __Next__ or
__Previous__ to switch to a different song, then switch back.

##### Actions Menu

<div markdown style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: center;">
![se-actions](https://ballroomdj4.sourceforge.io/wikiimg/en/Management/se-actions-B.png)
<br><span style="color:#4559bf;">**Manage / Song Editor / Actions Menu**</span> </div>

__MPM__ starts the BPM/MPM Counter.

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Copy&nbsp;Audio&nbsp;Tags__ starts a dialog to
copy the audio tags from one audio file to another.

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;All__ starts the batch edit
process.  ___This function is not yet implemented___.

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Apply&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;All__ finalizes the
batch edit process. The changes made to the current song will be made
to the rest of the selected songs.  ___This function is not yet
implemented___.

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Cancel&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;All__ cancels the
batch edit process. The changes made to the current song will be
reverted. ___This function is not yet implemented___.

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Apply&nbsp;Adjustments__ starts a dialog to
modify the audio file.  The audio file may have its silence trimmed,
or adjusted to apply the song start, song end and speed adjustments.
The original audio file is saved and can be restored.

__Actions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Restore&nbsp;Original__ is only active if the
audio file has been modified with the __Apply&nbsp;Adjustments__
action.  Selection __Restore&nbsp;Original__ will revert any changes
made and restore the original audio file.

##### Using the BPM Counter

Before using the BPM Counter, the BPM setting should be added to the
song editor using
[Display&nbsp;Settings](en-Configuration-Display%20Settings).

After selecting the song to edit in the song editor, use the __Play__
button to play the song.  Then select the _MPM_ menu selection in the
__Actions__ menu.  The BPM Counter will start.

stabilized, select the __Save__ button.  To restart the count, select
the __Reset__ button.
